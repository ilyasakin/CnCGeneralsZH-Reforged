				 The spot in the build list is taken, so this walks a square ring outwards looking for
				 one that is not, and for a skirmish AI it walks it 120 pathfind cells out - most of a
				 generated map. Every position costs a call to isLocationLegalToBuild, which is a
				 partition query for overlapping objects and a zone check for a route to it, and the
				 rings get longer the further out they go: 3,720 of them by the outermost, 46ms in one
				 logic frame, measured, and the worst frame of a four-player Twilight Flame match.
				 It is rare - four such frames in 55,876 - and that is exactly what a stutter is.

				 So the scan gets a budget and remembers where it was. It stops at the end of whichever
				 ring takes it past BUILD_PROBES_PER_FRAME positions, asks to be called again next
				 frame, and carries on from that ring; the positions are tried in the same order they
				 always were, so the spot it settles on is the spot it would have found in one go. The
				 budget counts positions rather than milliseconds on purpose: a stopwatch would test a
				 different number of them on a slower machine, and the two would desync.

				 A ring is finished once started rather than resumed part way through, which keeps the
				 whole of the state in one number.

				 The budget is small because the positions are not equally expensive. The rings near
				 the base are the dear ones - the partition query there comes back full of the
				 player's own buildings, and a position that gets past it pays for the terrain
				 sampling as well - while the outer rings are mostly off the map and are rejected on
				 the first line. A budget of 100 left a 19.7ms frame made of about 120 inner
				 positions; at 32 the first frame walks three rings and the worst frame this can cost
				 is either those, or one whole outer ring of 240 cheap ones.

				 That last claim was wrong. A four-player match on 2026-09-15 spent 20 to 37ms of eight
				 logic frames in a row here, and a timer put inside the loop showed why: the budget was
				 only checked between rings, and a ring 72 to 104 cells out holds 152 to 216 positions,
				 every one of them finished once started. So the budget is checked before every pair
				 of positions now, and the pair it stopped at is kept beside the ring, which is still
				 the same order and still the same spot. */
