/*
	This pool was CreateThread, a Win32 semaphore, an auto-reset event and Interlocked* over
	`volatile LONG`.  It is the standard library now (B8), because macOS has none of those and
	because the semantics below are the whole of what the pool needs - there was never anything
	Windows-specific about a fork-join pool.

	The two wakeups are the part worth reading before changing anything.  They are not the same
	primitive, and neither of them is a bare condition_variable notify - which is how a pool like
	this usually gets broken:

	  s_workReady was CreateSemaphore(0, MAX_WORKERS), released N-at-a-time per fork.  What makes
	  it a *counting* semaphore rather than an event is that its permits are **stored**.  A worker
	  that finished the previous fork is not necessarily back at the wait yet - it is somewhere
	  between decrementing s_workersBusy and looping round - and the next fork can start before it
	  gets there.  A permit released into that gap has to still be there when the worker arrives.
	  A plain notify_all has no memory: it wakes whoever is waiting at that instant and is lost on
	  everyone else, so that worker would sleep through a fork it had been counted into,
	  s_workersBusy would never reach zero, and parallel_for would hang forever.

	  So: an integer permit count under the mutex, with the wait keyed on a predicate over it.
	  notify_all then only ever wakes threads up to re-test that predicate; the permit is the
	  state, and the state is what survives the gap.  (C++20's std::counting_semaphore is exactly
	  this and would be the one-liner, but the tree builds as C++17 - see the gameengine target's
	  CXX_STANDARD.)

	  s_allDone was CreateEvent(auto-reset), set by whichever worker decremented s_workersBusy to
	  zero, and waited on by the forking thread alone.  An auto-reset event also stores its signal:
	  if the last worker finishes before the forking thread reaches the wait, the wait returns at
	  once instead of blocking forever.  A predicate wait has that property for free, because the
	  predicate *is* the condition - s_workersBusy == 0 is already true, so the forking thread does
	  not block.  One waiter, so notify_one.

	Ordering, stated once so nobody has to derive it again:

	  - s_fn, s_context, s_count, s_grain and the reset of s_nextIndex are written by the forking
	    thread under s_lock, before the permits are published.  A worker reads them after it has
	    taken s_lock and claimed a permit.  That unlock/lock pair is what publishes them, which is
	    the role ReleaseSemaphore/WaitForSingleObject played before.
	  - s_workersBusy is a plain Int under s_lock although it was an InterlockedDecrement.  It is a
	    condition_variable predicate now, and a predicate has to be read and written under the
	    mutex the waiter holds.  Making it an atomic as well would not remove that requirement; it
	    would only make the code read as though the lock were optional.
	  - s_nextIndex is the one genuinely lock-free thing here, and the only ordering that came out
	    *weaker* than the Win32 original - see the comment inside runChunks.
