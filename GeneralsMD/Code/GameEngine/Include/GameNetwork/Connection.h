/**
 * The Connection class handles queues for individual players, one connection per player.
 * Connections are identified by their names (m_name).  This should accomodate changing IPs
 * in the face of modem disconnects, NAT irregularities, etc.
 * Messages can be guaranteed or non-guaranteed, sequenced or not.
 *
 *
 * So how this works is this:
 * The connection contains the incoming and outgoing commands to and from the player this
 * connection object represents.  The incoming packets are separated into the different frames
 * of execution.  This is done for efficiency reasons since we will be keeping track of commands
 * that are to be executed on many different frames, and they will need to be retrieved by the
 * connection manager on a per-frame basis.  We don't really care what frame the outgoing
 * commands are executed on as they all need to be sent out right away to ensure that the commands
 * get to their destination in time.

 * packet cost every player in the game a two-second stall before it was even tried again.  Their
 * own intent is commented out in doRetryMetrics(): "m_retryTime = m_averageLatency * 1.5".  It
 * could not be switched on as written - m_averageLatency is a 200-slot rolling mean over an array
 * that starts full of zeroes, so early in a game it reads near zero and a 1.5x multiple of that is
 * a packet storm.  What is used instead is the standard Jacobson/Karels estimator, which carries
 * its own variance term and therefore widens on a jittery link instead of hugging the mean.
 *
 * The floor keeps a LAN game from retransmitting faster than the ack can physically come back.
 * The ceiling is EA's old constant, so no link is ever served worse than the shipped behaviour.

 * duplicate by itself (FrameData::addCommand, and the old-frame test in processNetCommand); chat,
