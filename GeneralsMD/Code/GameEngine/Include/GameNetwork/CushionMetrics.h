	 outright.  That decision is worth getting right in both directions: slug when there is no

	 pays for nothing. */

		 the links that need the window get more of it than the old flat floor of ten ever gave them,

		 Three since the router stopped being counted as a leg of the trip (roomLatencySum).  The

	 ("the latency for the packet router is always 0") and then summed it anyway, and the router
	 measures a real round trip like everybody else.  Three players never showed it, because the two
	 worst are usually the other two.  Two players always did: the router's round trip plus the
	 guest's, which is the same trip twice, so the run-ahead covered a whole round trip where half

	 a player alt-tabbing, a map that took a moment - and the same stopwatch keeps running, and the
	 stall is filed as round trip time.  It is not: it is the answer to a question the run-ahead is
	 not asking.  A real match recorded 1.79 s and then 7.64 s on a link whose measured srtt was
	 51 ms; the run-ahead sized on them went from its usual 5 frames to 29 and then 64 - 2.1 seconds
	 of input delay - and stayed there while the sample sat in the average.

	 So a sample past any plausible round trip is discarded down to the ceiling rather than trusted.
	 A link genuinely that slow is not playable anyway, and clamping costs nothing there; the point
	 is that a stall can no longer buy a permanent delay for everyone.

	 Half a second of round trip is past where this game is playable, and it is what the clamp
	 has to be worth: two players pinned at the ceiling still only buy 18 frames of
	 run-ahead - 0.6 s - against the 64 frames the raw samples bought.  A link genuinely slower
	 than this loses at most 33 ms of one-way window, which RUNAHEAD_JITTER_FRAMES already covers.
	 ponytail: one ceiling for every link.  The self-calibrating version is the connection's own
	 srtt + 4*rttvar (Connection.h has both), if a real link is ever found that this undersizes.

	 It was half a second until the owner said the rooms this fork is played in sit at 200 to 300 ms
	 of ping.  The sample is that ping plus the game's own share of the trip - a frame of send
	 grouping each way and the time until the next pass reads the socket - and a 300 ms ping with
	 60 ms of jitter measured 0.38 s on average with single samples past 0.5, so the ceiling was
	 already cutting into links people play on and would have undersized the window on every one of
