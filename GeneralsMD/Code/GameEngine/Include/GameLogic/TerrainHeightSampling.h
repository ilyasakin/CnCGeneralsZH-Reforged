// FILE: TerrainHeightSampling.h //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Desc:   The simulation's terrain queries, as arithmetic over a map's heights and cliff bits.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* BaseHeightMapRenderObjClass's height maths, moved out of GameEngineDevice (T1).  Every unit's height,
	 every cliff test and every line of sight the simulation asks for was answered by the W3D terrain
	 render object, from the terrain visual's logical height map.  The arithmetic is here now, its text
	 unchanged, so that an engine without a W3D terrain answers the same questions the same way; the
	 render object's methods call these, so Windows runs the one copy.

	 What changed in the text, and only this:
	 - m_map, the render object's own map, is a parameter: renderMap where the original only tests it
		 for NULL, clipMap where getClipHeight reads it.  On Windows they are the same map
		 (DO_SEISMIC_SIMULATIONS is off), but which one each line read is kept.
	 - The line that chose the logical height map - TheTerrainVisual's, or m_map without one - stays in
		 the render object's methods, which pass what they chose as logicHeightMap.
	 - getMaxHeight(), the render object's highest sample, is the parameter maxHeight;
		 findMinMaxHeights is the pass in initHeightData that sets it.
	 Tests/terrain_golden.txt is what these must print for nine shipped maps, from the original code
	 run three ways (T1's task file). */
