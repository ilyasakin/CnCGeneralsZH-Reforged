// OrderQueue.h ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// The orders a player has lined up with shift, kept by the logic and handed to the units one at a
// time as they finish the one in front.
//
// The queue used to live on the client, which sent each next order over the network once it saw the
// last one was over.  Every step therefore waited a round trip, which at the 200-300 ms most players
// sit at is a visible pause at every corner, and the list belonged to the selection: clicking
// anything else threw it away.  Here the list belongs to the units it was given to, and it moves on
// the same logic frame on every machine.
//
// A queued order is an ordinary order message with MSG_QUEUE_NEXT_ORDER in front of it.  The logic
// keeps a copy of the message and dispatches it again, to the units that still hold the list, when
// its turn comes, so every kind of order the dispatcher knows can be queued without a line of its own
// here.
//
// The units that were told together form a chain and go through it together: nobody starts the next
// order until everyone left alive is done with this one, so an army does not string out across the
// map behind its fastest unit.  Selecting part of a chain and adding to it splits that part off with
// a copy of the list.  An order given without shift ends the list for the units it went to.  An
// upgrade bought with shift is a step as well, paid for when the chain reaches it.
//
// Everything here is logic state: it is saved with the player, and a replay rebuilds it from the
// recorded messages.
