// FILE: WaterGridMotion.h ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Desc:   The water grid's mesh motion, one step per logic frame (T1c, defect 17).
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* The water grid is simulation state kept in a render object.  On a map with a WaveGuide1 waypoint,
	 WaveGuideUpdate pushes velocity into WaterRenderObjClass's mesh and TerrainLogic::isUnderwater reads
	 the mesh's heights back, for pathfinding, locomotors, the partition manager and more.  Between the
	 two, the mesh moves: every point in motion is damped, pulled towards its preferred height and moved.

	 EA stepped that motion from the render object's update, on the client pass, at most once a pass,
	 gated on the logic frame having changed.  EA's loop ran one client pass per logic frame, so that was
	 one step a frame.  This fork's catch-up runs several logic frames behind one client pass, and a
	 machine that caught up k frames stepped the mesh once: grid heights came to depend on the machine's
	 frame-rate history (defect 17).

	 GameLogic::update now steps it, at its top, before anything in the frame reads or writes the grid -
	 where EA's client pass stood, just ahead of the logic frame - through TerrainVisual::updateWaterGrid.
	 The step is W3DWater.cpp's text unchanged, frame gate and all, but for these substitutions:
	 - currLogicFrame is a parameter where the original read TheGameLogic->getFrame() (0 without one);
	 - the render object's m_doWaterGrid, m_meshInMotion, m_meshData, m_gridCellsX and m_gridCellsY are
		 parameters of the same names without the m_;
	 - WaterRenderObjClass::IN_MOTION and WaterMeshData are this class's IN_MOTION and MeshPoint, which
		 WaterRenderObjClass now uses under its old names (the same members in the same order).
	 Tests/test_water_grid.cpp holds it to the original's own output, and shows the count per frame. */
