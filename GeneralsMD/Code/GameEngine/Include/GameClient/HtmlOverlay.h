// HtmlOverlay.h //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// An HTML page laid out by litehtml and drawn over the battlefield with the game's own 2D calls.
//
// The page covers the whole screen and CSS places what is on it.  A CSS pixel is a pixel of the
// 800x600 screen everything else was authored at, so a page keeps its proportions at any
// resolution, and font-size is the game font's point size at 800x600.  A background on <html> or
// <body> is not drawn: it is there for a browser, the battlefield is the game's background.
//
// An element with data-click="..." is a button; click() hands back that text and the caller
// decides what it means.  Clicks walk up from what is under the pointer to the first element
// that has one.  data-tip="..." is the tooltip of what it is on, found the same way by tip().
//
// Not drawn: rounded corners, clipping for overflow, list bullets, and gradients other than
// linear ones, which draw as their first colour.
