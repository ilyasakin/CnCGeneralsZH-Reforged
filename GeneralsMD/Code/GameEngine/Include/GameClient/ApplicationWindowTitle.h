///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* GameText.cpp names the window once it has the game's name from the .csf.  On Windows it sets
	 ApplicationHWnd's text.  Elsewhere the window belongs to the platform layer (C2's SdlGameEngine,
	 over SDL3), which gameengine does not link, so the layer that owns a window sets this hook and
	 GameText calls it.  NULL while there is no window: a headless run, or a test. */
