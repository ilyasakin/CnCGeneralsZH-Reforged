// Puts the state of the match on Razer hardware: the command bar on the letter
// keys, power on the digits, the generals powers on the function row, alerts on
// the navigation cluster, superweapons on the numpad, production along the
// bottom, and money on the mousepad.  Talks to the Chroma REST server on
// localhost, so it needs no SDK header, no import library and no DLL beside the
// exe: with Synapse absent the request fails and is tried again every few
// seconds.  The session is held only during a match with the option on; in the
// menus the board is left to Synapse.
