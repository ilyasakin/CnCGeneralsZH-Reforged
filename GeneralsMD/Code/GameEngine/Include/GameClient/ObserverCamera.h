// ObserverCamera.h ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Who drives a watcher's camera, and whose fog his screen is drawn in.
//
// The mode and the followed player are picked apart, from two lists.  Free is the camera in the
// watcher's own hands.  Director goes wherever the most things have been hit in the last few
// seconds and stays there a while before it looks for a hotter fight; with a player picked it
// counts only the fights that player is in.  Player shows what the followed player's own screen
// shows: a player's camera comes over the network a few times a second (MSG_SET_REPLAY_CAMERA), an
// AI, which has no camera, gets the narrowed director, and with nobody picked it does nothing.
// Scrolling with the keys or a drag, turning the camera or clicking the radar hands it back to the
// watcher, who keeps the player he picked.  The screen's edge does not scroll while this drives:
// the page's panel stands on the right one, and reaching for it used to scroll the map and take the
// camera from the director with nobody asking.
//
// The followed player is picked from his own list, not the selection: clicking a unit makes its owner
// the watched player, and the camera jumping to an enemy's screen on a click would be no use.  Fog
// on draws the followed player's fog, what he has seen and what he has not, and hides what he
// cannot see, stealthed units he has not detected included; following nobody it changes nothing.
// Nothing here is logic: the camera and the fog are this machine's picture only.
