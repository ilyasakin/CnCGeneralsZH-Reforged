// one-copy-at-a-time mutex is taken in WinMain long before TheGlobalData is around to hold a flag.
//
// Both read the *wide* command line on purpose.  WinMain tokenizes lpCmdLine in place and that
// buffer is the process's ANSI command line, so GetCommandLineA is truncated to the exe name and
// the first switch by the time anything asks.  GetCommandLineW is untouched.
