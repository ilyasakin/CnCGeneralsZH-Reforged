//
// The monitors on the desktop and the sizes each one offers, asked of Windows directly.
//
// The resolution list used to be the first Direct3D 9 adapter's, whichever monitor that was, while
// the display mode was changed on the primary and every window was put at the desktop's origin.  So
// the game could only ever be on the primary, and the list described the primary only by luck.
// Everything that places the window or picks its size asks here now: WinMain before the engine
// exists, which is why this is header-only and speaks plain C strings, applyWindowMode for
// borderless, W3DDisplay for the window and the options menu for both of its lists.
//
// A monitor is named by its GDI device, "\\.\DISPLAY2".  That is what Options.ini stores under
// Monitor and what ChangeDisplaySettingsEx takes.  A name that is empty, or that no monitor answers
// to any more because it was unplugged, means the primary.
