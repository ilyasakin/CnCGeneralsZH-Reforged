// Options.ini, read before the engine exists.  EarlyCommandLine.h's twin.
//
// Almost every setting can wait for TheGlobalData, and should.  One cannot: the window style is
// fixed by CreateWindow in WinMain, which runs before the memory manager, before the file system
// and long before anything has parsed a preferences file.  A window born with a caption cannot
// lose it later without flickering through a restyle, and borderless has to be born without one.
//
// So this reads the file the hard way - the user data directory out of the shell and the registry,
// then fopen and fgets - and answers one key at a time.  It is deliberately not a cache and not a
// parser: three lookups reopen the file three times, which costs microseconds once per process.
//
// The format is UserPreferences': "key = value", one per line, '=' separating, whitespace ignored
// around both halves.  A file the engine writes is always in that shape, so the two agree without
// sharing code.
