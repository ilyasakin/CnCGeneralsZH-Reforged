/** How much wall-clock debt the pacer will carry and pay back. A render pass slower than one
	logic frame owes the simulation more than one tick; without a catch-up the game speed just
	becomes the render speed. The cap is the anti-spiral: when the logic frame itself is what
	overran, the debt past this much is dropped and the match runs slow.

	It is a duration, not a frame count, because the frame count that duration buys depends on the
	game speed. Three frames - the number this used to be - is a tenth of a second at the retail
	30fps and half that at 60, so picking a faster game speed made the pacer give up on a slow
	render twice as early: at 60fps a match visibly ran in slow motion the moment the frame rate
	dropped under 20. See GameEngine_isLogicFrameDue in GameEngine.cpp. */

/**	How long the catch-up loop may keep starting new logic ticks before it gives up for this pass.

	A frame count cannot tell a cheap tick from an expensive one, and that is the whole difference
	between the two situations the loop is in.  Behind because the *renderer* hitched, the ticks are
	2ms each and paying three of them costs nothing.  Behind because eight Brutal AIs are all
	fighting at once, the ticks are 25ms each and paying three of them freezes the picture for 75ms
	on top of the render - which is exactly the 91ms and 113ms frames measured on Twilight Flame.

	So the loop is bounded by a clock as well as by a count: after each tick, another one only
	starts if the loop has spent less than this. Cheap debt still gets paid in full; expensive debt
	is left on the accumulator, where the existing cap stops it spiralling and the match honestly
	runs a touch slow instead of stopping dead. The worst case becomes this plus one tick.

	That is the intent the frame count was already written for - "when the logic frame itself is what
	overran, paying the debt would just queue more of the same work" - measured in the unit that can
	actually see it. */
