// FILE: MessageBoxFlags.h ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Desc:   The flags MessageBoxWrapper takes and the answers it gives, in the engine's own names.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* MessageBoxWrapper (Common/System/Debug.cpp) is the engine's message box.  Its flags and answers
	 were Win32's MB_* and ID* names, which exist only on Windows; the plan does not define Win32's
	 names elsewhere (as WCHAR is left undefined, and D3's generators use FF_* rather than D3D's).  So
	 these are the engine's names, with Win32's numbers: on Windows each is checked equal to the SDK's
	 below, so what reaches ::MessageBox is exactly what did; elsewhere they are the same numbers, for
	 the no-window path and, later, C2's SDL_ShowMessageBox.

	 Only the ones the engine passes or tests are here.  Calls straight to ::MessageBox, which are
	 Windows-only, keep the SDK's names. */
