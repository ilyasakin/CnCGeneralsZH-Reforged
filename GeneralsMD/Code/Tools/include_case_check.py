"""Fails if any #include in the POSIX build names a file in the wrong case.

Windows and a default macOS volume fold case, so `#include "vector.h"` finds `Vector.H` there and
nothing complains. Linux does not fold case, and the same line is a missing header. The first Linux
build of this tree found 300 such includes reaching 93 files. This check finds them from macOS,
without Linux.

How: for every translation unit in compile_commands.json, follow its includes the way the compiler
searches (the includer's own directory first for "", then each -I/-iquote/-isystem directory in
order), recursing into headers inside the source tree. An include that resolves only when case is
ignored is a finding. Existence is checked against directory listings, never os.path.exists, because
the host filesystem may fold case and answer yes.

What it does NOT see:
  - Files outside compile_commands.json. Windows-only code is not in a POSIX build, so it is not
    checked until it is ported, and it is checked then.
  - Includes inside #if branches that are not taken. This reads text, not the preprocessor, so it
    checks MORE branches than a build does, not fewer, and could flag an include no build uses.
    That errs toward a false alarm, never a silent miss.
  - Macro-expanded includes (#include SOME_MACRO). There are none in the tree today.
  - Case in anything but #include: CMake source lists, data file names, fopen paths.

What it checks first: that the working tree's names are git's names. On a case-folding host a
case-only rename can exist in the index and not on disk, or the reverse. `git reset` of a staged
rename leaves exactly that, and a later `git add -A` does not notice. The audit reads the disk, so
if the disk disagrees with git it would certify a tree nobody committed. Any tracked file whose
on-disk name differs from its index name, even by case alone, fails the run before the audit
starts. Outside a git checkout this precondition is skipped and the output says so.
