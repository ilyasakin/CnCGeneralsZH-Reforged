# Builds and tests the tree on Linux, in containers, from a Mac: {gcc, clang} x {arm64, amd64} in
# Release, and a fifth row, arm64 gcc in Debug.  Configure, build and ctest for each, then one table,
# then an exit status that is nonzero if any row did not pass.
#
# The Debug row is there because a Debug build is a different program: DEBUG_LOG, DEBUG_ASSERTCRASH
# and MEMORYPOOL_DEBUG compile in, reference symbols a Release build never names, and run checks a
# Release build never runs.  B1's tests linked in Release and not in Debug for exactly that reason,
# and nothing here saw it until a Debug build was tried by hand.  gcc, because it is the stricter of
# the two here (eager vtables, fortify).  arm64, because it is native and so the fast one.
#
# =============================================================================================
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
#
# It proves: the tree configures, builds and passes ctest under glibc and libstdc++, with GCC and
# with Clang, on both Linux architectures. That is where the non-Windows code stops leaning on
# whatever Apple's headers happened to include, and where GCC's stricter reading of the standard
# gets a say.
#
# It does NOT prove:
#   - Anything about Windows. No MSVC, no Windows SDK.
#   - Anything about a Linux the game runs on. Ubuntu 24.04's toolchain and glibc only. The
#     container has no display, no GPU and no sound, and nothing here launches the game.
#   - Anything the host filesystem hides.  The bind mount of the Mac's volume is case-insensitive
#     even inside the container, so each row builds from a copy on the container's own
#     case-sensitive filesystem, and checks that a wrongly-cased name really fails to resolve
#     before it trusts that copy.  Without the copy, this check could not see include-case bugs.
#   - A real amd64 machine. The amd64 rows run under Rosetta inside OrbStack's VM. That is the
#     same translation layer E3 relies on, and it has the same blind spots.
#   - Anything ctest does not cover. Targets kept out of the default build (EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL,
#     ZH_NOT_YET_PORTABLE) are not built at all, and a DISABLED test is not a passing one.
#   - Parity with macOS by itself. The table shows each row's disabled and skipped tests so the
#     comparison can be made. arch_differential skips on Linux by design (it needs Darwin's
#     -arch and Rosetta), and d3dx_oracle skips unless ZH_D3DX9_X64 is set, which it never is
#     here.
#
# It fails, rather than passes, when it cannot run: no docker, no daemon, or vendored sources
# missing. A check that cannot run and says "ok" is the failure this project has hit five times.
