# install-guard.sh: sourced, not run. Rule 9's before-and-after check of the install, for every
# harness that roots the game at a farm of it (a farm entry is a link into the install, so a write
# through one lands in the install).
#
#   install_snapshot <install> <file>
#       Every entry under <install>: a folder, or a file's size, modification time and BLAKE2 (read
#       only). Returns non-zero, and writes nothing usable, when the listing cannot be made or written.
#   install_verify <install> <before> <after>
#       Snapshots the install again into <after> and compares. Prints one verdict and returns it:
#         0  "ok: the install is as it was (...)"
#         1  "FAIL: THE INSTALL CHANGED:" and the lines that differ
#         2  "FAIL: COULD NOT VERIFY the install: <why>", when either listing is missing or empty, or
#            the second one could not be made. Never reported as a change: the 2026-09 false alarm was
#            a run whose work folder had vanished, so the after-listing could not be written, and the
#            comparison of nothing with something printed "INSTALL CHANGED" with an empty list.
#
# A harness treats 1 and 2 alike, as a failure; only the words differ, so a reader knows which it was.
