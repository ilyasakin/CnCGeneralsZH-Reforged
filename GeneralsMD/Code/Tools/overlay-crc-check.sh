# P1 step 1's multiplayer check: the fork's overlay searched as a read root (decision 9) must give the
# game exactly what Windows' one folder gives it. Two layouts are built from the same install and the
# same overlay files:
#
#   W  the Windows shape: one folder, the install with the overlay's files copied into it, as
#      generals' post-build copies Code/Data over Run/ on Windows (replay-check.sh's farm);
#   P  the package shape: the install alone as the root, and the overlay as a separate folder passed
#      with -overlay, the code path the app bundle takes.
#
# One short skirmish runs in each, and three values from each run's log must be identical:
#   - "EXE CRC"   GlobalData's executable CRC, which off Windows is the version and the two script files
#                 (SkirmishScripts.scb, MultiplayerScripts.scb): decision 5's inputs;
#   - "INI CRC"   GameEngine::init's checksum over the INI set as loaded: the multiplayer INI check;
#   - the last "HEADLESS CRC", the world state at the last frame.
# Two armed controls, each of which must NOT match W:
#   - P without -overlay: the EXE CRC must differ. That run stops before its INI CRC, since the fork's
#     code needs the fork's INIs (decision 9 records that first stop), so this control shows only that
#     the overlay is seen, not that an INI difference would be;
#   - P with one value changed in the overlay (BalanceReforged.ini's first BuildCost, 1000 to 1001),
#     which runs through: its INI CRC must differ. That is the INI check being able to fail.
#
# The overlay is what ships (P1): Data/INI, Data/Patch.str, Data/Scripts, Data/Turkish,
# Install_Final.bmp, Art/Textures and Window from Code/Data, and the fork's Reforged*.big from
# GeneralsMD/Run when vendor.sh has fetched them (linked, not copied: 1.65 GB). Both layouts get the
# same files, so what differs is only where they sit.
#
# RULE 9: neither layout's root is the install itself. The install is linked file by file into a farm
# (and, for W, the overlay copied over the links, each link removed before its copy is written).
# The install is listed (sizes, times, BLAKE2) before this script writes anything and again at the end,
# and must be unchanged (Tools/install-guard.sh).
#
# Usage: overlay-crc-check.sh --generals <path> [--data <dir>] [--maxframes 600] [--keep]
# Exit status: 0 when W and P agree and the control differs; 1 otherwise; 77 without game data.
