# asan-check.sh: the whole game under AddressSanitizer, in a ZH_SANITIZE=address build
# (docs/porting/sanitizers.md).  Two runs, and each must exit 0 with no ASan report:
#   mobstress  headless, the mobstress scenario on Alpine Assault, seed 1, --mob-frames (default 12000): the
#              simulation, the allocator and its locks, the job threads
#   skirmish   -offscreen and -noaudio at 1920x1080, the seed-1234 generated skirmish, --skirmish-frames
#              (default 1800): the same plus the GPU device (Metal on macOS, Vulkan on Linux) and the
#              system frameworks under it
# Each run ends with the game's reset after the match, where the use-after-free ZH_SANITIZE first found was.
#
# WHAT A PASS SAYS: ASan saw no invalid access on these two paths in these frames.  Not that there is none
# elsewhere (the network, the shell, saves), and nothing about leaks: detect_leaks is off, because the
# engine frees much of its memory only at exit, or never.
#
# RULE 9, as replay-check.sh has it: the root is a farm of links in a temporary folder, the install is
# listed before and after (install-guard.sh), and the user data and logs stay in that folder.  The
# overlays are staged from this tree by stage-overlay.sh, the shipped one and the dev one (the scenarios).
#
# Usage: asan-check.sh --generals <path> [--data <dir>] [--mob-frames <n>] [--skirmish-frames <n>] [--keep]
#   --generals  a ZH_SANITIZE=address build's generals (refused if ASan is not in it)
#   --data      a folder holding zerohour/; default $ZH_DATA_DIR
#   --keep      leave the temporary folder, with the runs' output and any ASan report, and say where
# Prints one line per run and then "asan-check: PASS" or "asan-check: FAIL".
# Exit status: 0 both runs clean; 1 a run failed (non-zero exit, an ASan report, or no frame limit
# reached); 2 usage, or not an ASan build; 77 no game data; 99 the install changed, or could not be checked.
