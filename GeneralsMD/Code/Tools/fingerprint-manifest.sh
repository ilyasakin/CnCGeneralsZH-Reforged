#   fingerprint-manifest.sh --check    exit 1 if the committed manifest is out of date, 77 without git
#
# Left out, because a vendoring or build run rewrites their bytes and two checkouts of one commit would
# then disagree: Libraries/Source/FFmpeg/dist/ and dist-arm64/ (Windows' FFmpeg, x64 and ARM64, rebuilt by
# Tools/ffmpeg-build.sh).
# The manifest itself is left out too (it would hash its own list).
#
# Refused while the index has unmerged entries (a merge or rebase stopped on a conflict): `git ls-files`
# lists an unmerged path once per stage, so a manifest written then names it up to three times, and a
# check run then compares against a list that is not a commit's.  The list is deduplicated anyway, and
# --check names any line the committed manifest holds more than once.
