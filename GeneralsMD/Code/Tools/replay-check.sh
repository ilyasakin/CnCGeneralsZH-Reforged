# replay-check.sh: replay-check.ps1's POSIX twin (E1).  For each seed, plays a headless skirmish, plays
# its own replay back, plays the same seed a second time, and compares the three runs' CRC of every
# object in the world at the frame they stopped on: the last "HEADLESS CRC: 0x... at frame N" line,
# which any build writes at the end of an unattended run.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  Same-machine determinism only: a recording and its playback
# walk the same frames, and two runs from one seed agree, on this machine and this build.  That catches
# uninitialised memory, iteration order that depends on addresses, and anything else that differs
# between two runs of one binary.  It says NOTHING about whether this build agrees with a Windows build:
# that needs a replay recorded on Windows, played back here, and none exists yet.  Do not call a pass
# "parity" (E1's task file).
#
# A mismatch names the frame the CRC was taken at, not the frame the runs parted: it says a divergence
# happened, not where.  -DebugCRCFromFrame narrows it down afterwards.
#
# RULE 9: the game never runs with the real install as its root.  The root is a farm in a temporary
# folder: the install's directories made anew and every file a symbolic link, and nothing is written
# into it.  The fork's own data is the overlay the app bundle carries (P1): staged by
# Tools/stage-overlay.sh, the zh_overlay target's script, and passed with -overlay, so these runs
# resolve every file as the shipped game does (packaging-resolution-check.sh proves that layout equal
# to Windows' one folder).  The user data
# (ZH_USER_DATA_DIR) is in the same folder, and the folder is removed at the end.  The logs go next to
# the executable, as on Windows, each under its own -logPrefix, and are removed once read.
#
# Usage: replay-check.sh --generals <path> | --app <.app> [--data <dir>] [--seeds "0 1"] [--players 2]
#          [--aidiff brutal] [--maxframes 12000] [--cells <n>] [--extra "<args>"]
#          [--control] [--extended] [--keep]
#   --data            a folder holding zerohour/ (with the base game in zerohour/ZH_Generals, as the
#                     install has it); default $ZH_DATA_DIR
#   --cells           playable cells a side of the generated map.  Default: none given, so the
#                     generator sizes the map for the player count (normal).  replay-check.ps1 passes
#                     128, below even the generator's small size for two players, and at 128 seed 1
#                     puts the two starts 124 units apart: both AIs judge every build site unsafe and
#                     the match stays idle, so a CRC over it proves little
#   --extra           switches for every run of every seed.  One that reaches the match has to be on
#                     for the recording and the playback alike
#   --control         the harness's own armed control: before the playback, the kept replay's game
#                     seed (SD= in its header) has its last digit changed, so the playback plays a
#                     different world from the same commands, and every seed must be reported DIVERGED
#   --extended        the wider backstop, not in ctest: seeds 2 to 5, each at 2 and at 4 players (eight
#                     matches), at --maxframes (default 12000).  --seeds and --players are ignored
#   --keep            leave the temporary folder and the logs, and say where
#   --app <.app>      E1 on the bundle itself, "tests what ships" (P1 step 5): its Contents/MacOS/generals
#                     runs with NO -root and NO -overlay, so the bundle's own discovery finds both - its
#                     overlay in Contents/Resources, and the install through Registry.ini's InstallPath,
#                     which names the farm (rule 9 as ever; HOME is an empty folder, so the known places
#                     cannot find anything).  Its logs are the bundle's, in the user data's Logs/.  After
#                     every run the bundle's signature must still verify --deep --strict: nothing may be
#                     written into it.  Replaces --generals
# Exit status: the number of matches that failed (0 when all agree), plus one for a broken seal (--app).
# 77 when there is no game data.
# 99 when the install changed during the run, or when that could not be checked: every file of it is
# listed with its hash before the farm is built and again at the end (Tools/install-guard.sh). A
# difference is "THE INSTALL CHANGED"; a listing that is missing or could not be made is "COULD NOT
# VERIFY", never a change. Either fails the run whatever the matches said.
