# P1 step 2's proof that the game cannot write its install: the roots are read-only, so every write the
# engine addresses relative to the install is refused (posixpath's refuses_write) rather than done.
#
# One short skirmish, rooted at a farm of the install (its folders made anew, every file a link) with
# the shipped overlay passed as -overlay, as the package runs. Into the farm goes one real file the
# engine is known to try to delete on every start, Data/INI/INIZH.big (GameEngine::init's patch-1.01
# clean-up). Afterwards:
#   - the planted file is still there, and the run reports (stderr) that the deletion was refused;
#   - the farm's listing (every name, and every link's target) is what it was before the run;
#   - the install's listing (every file's size, modification time and BLAKE2 hash, taken before this
#     script writes anything and again after both runs) is what it was. That is the rule-9 listing
#     diff, and the one that matters: a write through a farm link would land in the install.
# The armed control: a run with -writableRoot must delete the planted file, so the check can see a
# write when one happens. It runs in a root holding only that file, never in a farm of the install.
#
# RULE 9 still holds while this runs: the root is a farm, never the install.
#
# Usage: root-readonly-check.sh --generals <path> [--data <dir>] [--maxframes 600] [--keep]
