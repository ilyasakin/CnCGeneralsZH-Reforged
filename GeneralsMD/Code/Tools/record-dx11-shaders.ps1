.SYNOPSIS
  Records the Direct3D 11 programs the game compiles into Data\dx11shaders.shipped.

.DESCRIPTION
  The Direct3D 11 backend compiles each generated program with d3dcompiler_47 the first time a pipeline
  needs it, and keeps the bytecode in the player's dx11shaders.cache. Under Wine, d3dcompiler_47 is
  vkd3d-shader, and one of those compiles took minutes (X2, a contributor on the Deck): the game looked hung on its
  first frame. The backend reads dx11shaders.shipped, next to the exe, before it compiles anything, so the
  programs recorded here are never compiled on a player's machine.

  This plays AI-against-AI skirmishes with the picture drawn by Direct3D 11, on a Windows machine whose
  d3dcompiler_47 is Microsoft's. It does so at the default post chain and with it off, on a few seeds,
  plus the shell map. It starts each run from an empty cache: the player's cache is moved aside and put
  back afterwards, and the farm's shipped file is unlinked. What the runs compiled is then the shipped
  file. The bytecode is exactly what run-time D3DCompile gives on this machine, because it is that output.
  A program the recording never met is compiled on the player's machine, as before.

  Every run is unattended (ZH_UNATTENDED), in a farm made by windows-ci.ps1's own New-Farm, and killed at
  -TimeoutMinutes.
