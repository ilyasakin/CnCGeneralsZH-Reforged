# Builds the FFmpeg the game links against, with the codecs it opens and nothing else.
#
# Run it through ffmpeg-build.bat, which supplies the MSVC environment. The result lands in
# Libraries/Source/FFmpeg/dist, laid out the way CMakeLists.txt expects: include/, lib/*.lib,
# bin/*.dll. Those DLLs are post-build copied next to generals.exe and are what the payload ships.
#
# What the game opens, and therefore all that is built:
#   .bik movies  -> bink demuxer, the bink video decoder and both binkaudio decoders
#   .mp3 music   -> mp3 demuxer and decoder, mpegaudio parser
#   .wav speech  -> wav demuxer, the PCM decoders and the two ADPCM flavours its files use
# avfilter, avdevice, the programs, the network layer and every other codec are off. A stock
# general-purpose build of the same version is 123MB of DLLs; this is 3.3MB.
#
# The version matters: the library majors decide the DLL names (avcodec-62 and friends), which
# CMakeLists.txt and launcher/build-payload.js both name.
#
# ZH_FFMPEG_ARCH=aarch64 (ffmpeg-build.bat arm64) builds Windows on ARM64 into dist-arm64 instead,
# without FFmpeg's assembly: its AArch64 .S files need gas-preprocessor in front of armasm64, and the
# C paths are what the other ports' decoders are checked against anyway.
