# net-check.sh: net_check.py's POSIX twin (L1).  Two headless copies of the game on this machine play
# one seeded LAN match against each other (-netgame, no lobby), each with its own user data; then each
# copy's replay is played back alone.  The match passes when:
#   - both copies started the network game and neither log holds "CRC Mismatch" (the copies compare
#     their CRCs over the network every interval, so this is the game's own desync detector);
#   - both logged the same CRC on the frame --frames names ("HEADLESS CRC AT LIMIT": the engine logs it as
#     the logic finishes that frame, and a catch-up burst stops there), and neither stopped before it;
#   - the AI built something after frame 0 on both (an idle world agrees with itself and proves little);
#   - each copy's replay, played back alone, logs that same CRC at that frame.
# It compares at that one frame, never at the frame a copy happened to stop on: two copies under load once
# stopped on 1801 and 1802, and a comparison there can only disagree.
#
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  Two processes of POSIX builds on ONE machine keep one world
# over the real network code (Transport, the lockstep, the CRC exchange) through the kernel's own
# delivery between two local addresses.  With --peer1 naming an x86_64 build run under Rosetta, the
# two copies are two architectures of one compiler.  It says NOTHING about:
#   - a Windows peer (MSVC's code generation, its 32-bit long, its CRT);
#   - a real network: traffic between two addresses of one host never leaves the kernel, so there is no
#     latency, loss, reordering or MTU to meet (the game's -latAvg/-latNoise/-packetloss simulate some);
#   - the LAN lobby: -netgame skips it, so discovery, joining, map transfer and chat are not exercised;
#   - more than two humans.
#
# THE ADDRESSES.  One port (8088, and the lobby's 8086) serves every address and the game finds its own
# slot by address, so two copies need two addresses.  macOS configures only 127.0.0.1 on loopback (an
# alias needs root), so the second is one of the machine's own: the first up, non-loopback IPv4 address
# that a probe finds delivering to and from 127.0.0.1.  None: exit 77.  Both ports must be free on both.
#
# THE FIREWALL.  A copy listening on a non-loopback address makes the macOS application firewall ask
# "accept incoming connections?" in a dialog, when it is on.  This harness must never put that up, so on
# macOS it reads socketfilterfw's global state, stealth mode and block-all first and skips (77) unless
# all three are off - before the probe, which listens too.  What that check cannot see: third-party
# network filters (Little Snitch, LuLu and the like) that ask on their own, pf rules, and a firewall
# switched on between the check and the run.  Off macOS there is no such dialog and nothing is read.
#
# ONE AT A TIME, MACHINE-WIDE.  The game's ports are the machine's, and two net-checks from two worktrees
# (ctest's RESOURCE_LOCK holds only within one ctest) once collided: the copy that could not bind 8088
# spun in Transport::init's bind retry, leaking a socket per try, until the machine's file table was full
# (2026-09-26).  So before its probe the harness takes an exclusive lock on one fixed path,
# /tmp/zhr-net-check.lock (NET_CHECK_LOCK_FILE), and waits for it (NET_CHECK_LOCK_WAIT, 900 s, then skips).
# The lock is flock(2), taken through python3's fcntl (macOS has no flock(1)) on descriptor 9, which the
# harness and both copies of the game inherit: the kernel holds it until every one of them has exited -
# a copy that outlives a killed harness keeps it - and releases it however they end, so it cannot go
# stale.  And every copy runs under `ulimit -n` of NET_CHECK_FD_LIMIT (4096): a leak ends in EMFILE for
# that copy instead of the machine.  A watchdog stops both copies once either holds three quarters of
# that, and fails the run saying so.
#
# RULE 9: the game never runs with the real install as its root: a farm of links, the overlay staged
# as the app ships it, the user data in the work folder, the install hashed before and after
# (Tools/install-guard.sh), exit 99 if it changed or could not be checked.
#
# Usage: net-check.sh --generals <path> [--peer1 <path>] [--data <dir>] [--seed 3] [--frames 3000]
#          [--netai 2] [--map "Maps\Golden Oasis\Golden Oasis.map"] [--control] [--corrupt-at <frame>] [--legacy-replay]
#          [--overshoot-control] [--keep]
#   --peer1     the executable for the second copy (default: --generals); an x86_64 build runs under
#               Rosetta as it is
#   --corrupt-at <frame>
#               the playback check's control: before copy 0's replay is played back, every CRC it
#               recorded at the first CRC frame at or after <frame> is changed by one bit.  Copy 0's
#               playback must then report "out of sync" at exactly that frame (so the check is live
#               to the end of the replay), and copy 1's untouched replay must still play back clean
#   --legacy-replay
#               the other alignment: before copy 1's replay is played back, the records of the first
#               frame that carries CRCs are removed, which leaves it shaped like a replay recorded
#               before d9eccdda or by the retail game (no frame 0 CRC).  Its playback must say
#               "legacy: frame 0 missing" and stay in sync
#   --overshoot-control
#               the frame comparison's control: copy 0 runs one frame past --frames and copy 1 two
#               (ZH_TEST_FRAME_LIMIT_OVERSHOOT), as load once made them; the match must still agree at
#               --frames, and the report names where each stopped
#   --control   the armed control: the second copy is given the next seed, so the two copies start
#               different worlds from one command stream; the match must be reported FAILED with a CRC
#               mismatch, so a pass means the check can see one
#
# TWO HOSTS (W1).  Driven from a third machine over ssh, one copy per host, so each side runs behind its
# own guards (firewall, machine lock, ports, farm, install hash, descriptor cap):
#   net-check.sh --generals <exe> --peer <slot> --hosts <addr0>,<addr1> [--replay-out <file>] ...
#               plays the one copy for <slot> (its address must be this machine's), plays its own replay
#               back, copies the replay to --replay-out, and prints one line:
#               PEER-RESULT slot= crc= frame= mismatches= dropped= built= ended= back_crc= back_frame= aligned="" oos=""
#               dropped counts the players this copy disconnected.  A copy whose partner never came (or left)
#               does not stop: after NetworkDisconnectTime and the disconnect screen it drops the other slot
#               and plays on alone to a clean end with no mismatch (measured, 2026-09-27: a lone peer 1
#               logged "disconnecting slot 0 on frame 30" and still reached --frames).  So dropped must be 0.
#   net-check.sh --generals <exe> --play <replay file> [--frames N]
#               plays a replay recorded elsewhere (the other host's) and prints
#               PLAY-RESULT crc= frame= aligned="" oos=""
# The driver compares the lines: the two live CRCs, each replay played on its own host and on the other.
# On Linux the firewall gate reads iptables and nft (through sudo -n) and skips if the input chain drops or
# rejects, or if it cannot tell (NET_CHECK_FIREWALL_UNKNOWN_OK=1 goes ahead anyway).
#
# Exit status: 0 the match agrees; 1 it does not; 77 skipped (no data, no second address, a port in
# use for NET_CHECK_PORT_WAIT seconds (600), the firewall on, or no python3 for the probe); 99 the install
# changed or could not be checked.
