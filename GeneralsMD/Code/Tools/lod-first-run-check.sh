# Decision 2 for the GPU, run for real: a first launch off Windows chooses the top detail preset the CPU
# and memory rules allow, where before every Mac's chose LOW.
#
# Before the rule, the POSIX device answered no vendor or device ID W3DShaderManager::getChipset knows,
# so it said DC_UNKNOWN; GameLOD presumed a TNT2, and every LODPreset in the shipped GameLODPresets.ini,
# LOW included, asks for a GF3 or a GF4, so none matched and the default LOW stood. Now
# testMinimumRequirements reports an unplaced device as the top of the chipset table. The CPU half is
# decision 2's first rule: an unknown CPU type runs the benchmark, whose POSIX stub beats every
# BenchProfile, and GameLOD adopts the last profile a preset's speed takes (K7 1500 in the shipped file),
# which reaches HIGH ("HIGH K7 1500 GF3 512") with 512 MB or more.
#
# Three short headless skirmishes, each rooted at a farm of the install with the staged overlay:
#   1. a first launch, from an empty user data folder: Options.ini must say IdealStaticGameLOD = High
#      and StaticGameLOD = High;
#   2. a later launch from the same folder: both still High (the later launch reads them, and does not
#      choose again);
#   3. the armed control: a first launch with -noshaders, which forces the chipset to a Voodoo2 (an
#      override, which the rule leaves alone). Below every preset, it must choose Low - so a High in 1
#      is this rule's doing, and this check can see a Low.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT SEE: a machine with less than 512 MB (every Mac the port supports has more), and
# Windows, where the rule is not compiled and the original presumption stands.
#
# RULE 9: the root is a farm, never the install, and the install is listed before and after
# (Tools/install-guard.sh).
#
# Usage: lod-first-run-check.sh --generals <path> [--data <dir>] [--keep]
# Exit status: 0 on a pass; 1 otherwise; 77 without game data.
