The substitutes match the advance widths and even\n\t usWinAscent/usWinDescent, but have no VDMX, and GDI takes tmAscent and tmDescent from VDMX: without\n\t this, 30 to 38 of the 43 sizes below come out 1 or 2 pixels shorter than on Windows (L1b).\n\n\t WHAT THESE ARE: measured integers, TEXTMETRIC\'s tmAscent and tmDescent (tmHeight is their sum at\n\t every size here), per pixel height.  No font data is included: no outlines, no hinting, no table\n\t copied from a font file.\n\n\t HOW THEY WERE MEASURED (2026-09-27, by a contributor): Tools/gdi-font-metrics.ps1 in a Windows VM, GDI itself:\n\t CreateFont( -ppem, 0, 0, 0, FW_NORMAL or FW_BOLD, 0, 0, 0, DEFAULT_CHARSET, OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS,\n\t CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS, ANTIALIASED_QUALITY, VARIABLE_PITCH, face ) - render2dsentence.cpp\'s own call -\n\t selected into a memory DC, then GetTextMetrics.  GetTextFace confirmed each face; tmOverhang was 0 at\n\t every size; the "Generals" lfWidth (0.40 x the height) changed no ascent or height.\n'
MIDDLE = "\t Cross-checks: Arial at 13 px is 13 + 3 = 16, test_fontchars' number; and macOS's own Arial, Times\n\t New Roman and Courier New (5.01 and alike, regular and bold), through glyphrasteriser.cpp's VDMX\n\t rule, give the same ascent and height at all 43 sizes, so a Mac, which reads those files, needs none\n\t of this. */\n\n#pragma once\n\nstruct GdiFontMetrics\n{\n\tconst char *face;\t\t\t\t\t///< the Windows face these are GDI's metrics for\n\tbool bold;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t///< FW_BOLD\n\tunsigned char ascent[43];\t///< tmAscent at ppem GDI_METRICS_FIRST_PPEM + i\n\tunsigned char descent[43];\t///< tmDescent at the same\n};\n\nenum { GDI_METRICS_FIRST_PPEM = 6, GDI_METRICS_LAST_PPEM = 48 };\n\nstatic const GdiFontMetrics theGdiFontMetrics[] =\n{"
