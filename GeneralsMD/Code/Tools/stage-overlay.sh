# Stages the fork's overlay (P1, decision 9): the folder the game searches before its install root,

# root-readonly-check.sh, packaging-resolution-check.sh) stage the same files the same way.

# The shipped overlay, from generals' Windows post-build list (CMakeLists.txt) less what package.bat
# leaves out, as P1 inferred it (to be confirmed against upstream's release tooling):
#   Data/INI/, Data/Patch.str, Data/Scripts/, Data/Turkish/, Install_Final.bmp, Art/Textures/, Window/
# and the fork's art archives, Reforged*.big from the Run folder when vendor.sh has fetched them,
# LINKED here (1.65 GB): the bundle step copies them through the links.
# --dev stages the development-only folders instead, Scenarios/ and Cinema/ (-scenario, -cinema),
# which never ship: a second overlay the tools pass, so E1 runs exactly the shipped one.
#
# <out> is removed and made anew first, so every file is written into a folder of its own and never
# through a link (the lesson of P1 step 2's incident).
