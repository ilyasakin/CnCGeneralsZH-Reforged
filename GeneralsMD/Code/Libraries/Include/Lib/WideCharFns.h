/* The engine carries text in WideChar.  The C library has no string functions for it: the wcs*
	 family is wchar_t, which MSVC makes 2 bytes and clang makes 4, so calling wcslen on engine
	 text is a width bug that only shows up when the compiler changes.  These are the engine's
	 own, and they are correct at either width - which is why they can be written and reviewed
	 before the typedef moves rather than after.

	 They are deliberately NOT named wcs*, and deliberately not macros or overloads over those
	 names.  Common/Audio/urllaunch.cpp and simpleplayer.cpp call the real CRT wcsstr, wcscpy,
	 wcsncpy, wcslen, wcspbrk and swprintf on real LPWSTRs handed to them by the Windows shell and
	 by Windows Media, and they must keep doing exactly that.  A macro over wcslen would break
	 those two files from three directories away, which is the worst way to find out.

	 On Windows every function below that can forward to the CRT does, through a cast, so the
	 Windows build keeps the behaviour it has today.  char16_t and wchar_t are layout-compatible
	 there, so the cast is honest.  Off Windows these are the implementation.

	 Two exceptions, both marked at their declaration: WideCharICmp and WideCharNICmp fold ASCII
	 only, on every platform, and do not forward to _wcsicmp. */

/* _vsnwprintf has no char16_t form on any platform and never will.  Every wide format in the
	 engine goes through here: UnicodeString::format_va (both overloads) and InGameUI's three
	 message() variants.  Do not add a second one.

	 **The contract is MSVC's `_vsnwprintf`, on both platforms, on purpose.**  At most `outCount`
	 code units are written, the terminator counted among them.  On success the return is the
	 number written not counting the terminator, and `out` is terminated.  **On truncation the
	 return is negative.**  All five call sites branch on that sign - two throw
	 ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY and three log and truncate - so a bare POSIX `vswprintf`, which returns
	 the would-be length instead, would silently turn a truncated chat line into a success on the
	 Mac and nobody would notice until a long player name reached the UI.

	 One deliberate difference from MSVC, in the single case where MSVC is already wrong: an
	 output of exactly `outCount` code units.  MSVC writes them, does NOT terminate, and returns
	 `outCount`; UnicodeString::format_va then calls set() on an unterminated buffer and reads
	 past its end.  Off Windows that case reports truncation instead, which is what the call
	 sites are written for.  It costs one character of the longest possible message and removes a
	 buffer overread.

	 The format's meaning is MSVC's LEGACY wide printf, on both platforms: %s, %ls and %ws are
	 WideChar strings and %c a WideChar; %S and %hs are narrow strings and %C/%hc a narrow char.
	 That is the opposite of C99's vswprintf for %s and %S, and it is what every wide format in
	 this tree was written against.  Off Windows the funnel therefore formats strings and
	 characters itself and hands the C library only the numeric conversions (WideCharFns.cpp
	 explains), so a WideChar* argument is read correctly at any width.  %n is refused.
	 Tests/test_widechar_format.cpp holds the expected output, and on Windows it checks the same
	 expectations against the real _vsnwprintf. */

	  Used by the replay header (Recorder.cpp), which writes each string with this and then a
	  `fputwc(0, ...)`, and reads it back one `fgetwc` at a time.  The bytes that reach the disk
	  are whatever the C library's wide-to-multibyte conversion produces for the stream, and they
	  must not change: a replay written by one build has to be readable by the other.  On Windows
	  this is byte-for-byte the call it replaces.

	  See docs/mac-port/WINDOWS-DEBT.md: mixing fwrite and fwprintf on one FILE* is undefined, and
	  Recorder.cpp does it heavily.  MSVC tolerates it.  A POSIX C library sets the stream's
	  orientation on first use and then fails every call of the other kind, so the replay writer
	  needs a byte-oriented rewrite before it runs on a Mac.  That is C1/M2 work, not B1's, and

/* `DEBUG_LOG(("player %ls", name.str()))` tells the C library that the argument is a wchar_t*.
	 It is a WideChar*.  Those are the same thing under MSVC today and will still be the same size
	 there after the typedef moves, so this has always worked on Windows and always will - and it
	 is wrong on a Mac twice over.  Once for the width, and once because macOS's narrow printf has
	 to convert wide to multibyte through LC_CTYPE, which in the C locale a process starts in
	 fails with EILSEQ on anything outside ASCII.

	 So the argument is converted here instead, to UTF-8, by arithmetic on code units with no C
	 library conversion anywhere in it and therefore no locale behaviour to get wrong.  The format
	 then says %s, like any other string.

	 Do NOT reach for AsciiString::translate for this.  It is `concat((char)getCharAt(i))` with a
	 @todo above it admitting it only works for 7-bit ASCII: U+00C7 becomes byte 0xC7 and U+0130
	 becomes 0x30, the digit zero.  It would make the logs worse than the spelling it replaced.

	 One consequence worth knowing before reading a log: on Windows these bytes change.  %ls
	 converted through the process ANSI codepage, which rendered a name outside it as '?'; this
	 writes UTF-8.  DebugLogFile.txt is the file players send back, so that is a real change, not
	 a no-op - an improvement, but a change. */

	  unit - the mirror of WideCharToUtf8.  Anything that is not well-formed UTF-8 (a stray
	  continuation byte, a truncated or overlong sequence, an encoded surrogate, a value above
	  U+10FFFF) becomes one U+FFFD per bad byte.  For text the platform hands back as UTF-8 - a

	  carries its own buffer - which matters, because several call sites print two wide strings in
	  one statement and a shared scratch buffer would have the second overwrite the first.

	  Deliberately a fixed buffer and not an allocation: this is reached from DEBUG_CRASH and from
