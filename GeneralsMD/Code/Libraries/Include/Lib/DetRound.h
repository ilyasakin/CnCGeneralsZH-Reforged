// Float to long, rounding half to even, the same way on x64 and on arm64.
//
// This is dettrig.h's problem in one instruction, and it is here for the same reason: the
// simulation's arithmetic has to give the same answer on every machine in a network game, so the
// places where an architecture is free to choose get pinned to one choice by hand.
//
// What it replaces, and why it is not a cast.  EA wrote `fld` / `fistp`, which rounds in the FPU's
// current mode; the x64 port wrote that as SSE2's cvtss2si, which rounds in MXCSR's current mode.
// A C cast would truncate instead, and callers depend on the rounding - see the comment on
// WWMath::Float_To_Long and every WWMath::Float_To_Long(x - 0.499999f) in hrawanim.cpp, which is
// arithmetic built on top of round-to-nearest.
//
// Which mode "current" is.  GameLogic/FPUControl.cpp's setFPMode() sets _RC_NEAR and nothing else,
// and GameLogic::update re-asserts it at the top of every logic frame precisely because a graphics
// or audio driver may have left it somewhere else.  So the mode this conversion is designed to run
// in is round-to-nearest, ties to even.
//
// On arm64 that is FCVTNS - "convert to signed integer, rounding to nearest with ties to even" -
// which is what vcvtns_s32_f32 emits.  Two things follow, and the second is an improvement rather
// than a compromise:
//
//   1. It is bit-identical to cvtss2si under _RC_NEAR, which is the only mode the simulation is
//      ever supposed to be in.  test_detround.cpp checks the tie cases and sweeps the rest.
//   2. FCVTNS ignores FPCR's rounding field, so on arm64 this conversion cannot be perturbed by
//      anything that leaves the rounding mode somewhere else.  The whole class of bug that makes
//      setFPMode() get called every frame on Windows does not exist here for this operation.
//
// Inputs outside the range of a 32-bit integer, and NaN, are where the two architectures genuinely
// differ, and they differ in two separate ways.  Measured on both, not read off a manual:
//
//                    x86 cvtss2si / cvtsd2si      arm64 FCVTNS
//   out of range     0x80000000 ("indefinite")    saturates: 0x7FFFFFFF or 0x80000000
//   NaN              0x80000000                   0
//
// Neither is reachable from the simulation: the callers are frame numbers, scanline coordinates and
// pixel counts, and a NaN arriving here means the arithmetic upstream has already diverged.  So
// this is recorded rather than branched around - a range check in the two hottest conversions in
// the renderer would cost more than the case is worth, and a caller that genuinely could produce
// one wants its own check rather than a different instruction here.
//
// What is NOT left to chance is the width.  `long` is 64 bits on Darwin's LP64 and 32 on Windows'
// LLP64, so the obvious arm64 spelling for the double overload - convert to a 64-bit integer and
// let the return type narrow it - quietly means two different things on the two platforms, and on
// macOS means no narrowing at all.  An earlier version of this header said "narrowing afterwards is
// exact for every value a long can hold", which was true only on Windows and was the kind of
// sentence someone later builds on.  Both overloads now produce a 32-bit result explicitly, which
// is what cvtss2si and cvtsd2si produce and what every call site in the tree assigns to an int.
//
// Found by a contributor's cross-architecture harness, which runs the real x86 instructions under
// Rosetta and compares them against these: 11 of 75 rows differed, all of them here, none of them
// a tie or an in-range value.  Worth knowing why this file's own sweep could not see it: the sweep
// checks against the C library's round-to-nearest, and the C library on this machine has the same
// 64-bit long and the same saturation as the code under test.  Reference and code agreed with each
// other while both differed from x86.  A reference that shares the property under test proves
// nothing about it.
