// The engine's shaders by name, off Windows (A3e).  W3DShaderManager and the water register every shader
// they make with Direct3D11_Register_Engine_Shader, under the file it was loaded from ("shaders\\Trees.vso")
// or the name the water gives its run-time programs ("river water ps.1.1").  On Windows the Direct3D 11
// backend maps that name to D3's HLSL transcription (engineshader.cpp).  Off Windows the POSIX device does
// the same, because it never runs D3D bytecode: dx11runtime_posix.cpp passes the registration on here, and
// the draw asks the shader it has bound for its name.
//
// Implemented by the POSIX device (posixd3d9).  A shader the device did not make is ignored.
