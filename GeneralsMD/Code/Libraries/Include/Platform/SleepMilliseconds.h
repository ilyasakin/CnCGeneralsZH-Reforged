// A platform service, not a spelling, so it lives behind this name rather than in MSVCCompat.h.
// Windows keeps Sleep() exactly.  Elsewhere it is std::this_thread::sleep_for.  Every caller in the
// engine waits in a load screen, a video or a network hand-shake - none of them is a simulation
// step, so how long a sleep really lasts reaches no computed value.
//
// Not for 0: Sleep(0) on Windows means "yield the rest of my slice", which sleep_for(0) is allowed
// not to do (ThreadClass::Sleep_Ms in WWLib handles that case).  Nothing here passes 0.
