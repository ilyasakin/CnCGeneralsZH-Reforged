// The graphics backend drawing the picture off Windows, for the HUD corner that reads "DX9" or "DX11" on
// Windows (W3DDisplay::getRendererName).  Off Windows the device underneath is the SDL3 GPU one, so this
// names the SDL3 backend it runs on, with the architecture as Windows' names carry theirs: "Metal arm64"
// on an Apple silicon Mac, "Vulkan x64" on Linux, and "Headless" when there is no window and so no GPU.
//
// Implemented by the POSIX device (posixd3d9), which sets it when it makes its GPU frame.  The string is
// the device's, UTF-16, and lives as long as the program; asking for it never allocates.
