// strdup as the Windows build computes it, for the whole tree: one spelling.
//
// On Windows strdup is the UCRT's _strdup, which returns NULL for a NULL argument (as a contributor reads the UCRT;
// not measured by this project).  Darwin's and glibc's strdup read through the pointer instead.  The tree
// was written where copying a NULL name gave a NULL name, and at least one path depends on it: a particle
// emitter's user string is NULL until set, and the fog of war clones every emitter it ghosts, which crashed
// the Mac and Linux within seconds of a match on Seaside Mutiny (README, defect #31).
//
// Windows calls _strdup itself, exactly the function strdup already was there, so nothing changes on
// Windows by construction.  Elsewhere a NULL argument gives NULL, and anything else is strdup's copy.
