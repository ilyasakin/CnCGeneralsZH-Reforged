	   set out at length in mutex.h: same instruction on x86, a real one on arm64, and an unlock
	   that is a release store rather than a plain write to a volatile unsigned.

	   Two things about this copy that the other two do not have.  It is unreachable: nothing in
	   the tree includes internal.h, and nothing names ProfileFastCS.  And its wait was already a
	   no-op - `static HANDLE testEvent` is declared here and defined nowhere, so the `if
	   (testEvent)` was always false and taking the lock under contention was a bare busy spin
	   that would have failed to link the moment anybody used it.  yield() is what the branch was
