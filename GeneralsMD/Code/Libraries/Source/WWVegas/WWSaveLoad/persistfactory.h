	**
	** This used to be `uint32 objptr = (uint32)obj` with a matching `sizeof(uint32)`.  That was
	** right on Win32, where a pointer is four bytes.  It has been wrong since the x64 port, and
	** not subtly: Load() has always read `sizeof(T *)`, so on a 64-bit build Save writes 4 bytes
	** into the chunk and Load asks for 8.  ChunkLoadClass::Read refuses a read that would run past
	** the end of the chunk and returns 0 WITHOUT touching the buffer, so old_obj keeps its NULL
	** initialiser and every object in the stream registers under the key NULL.  Measured, not
	** reasoned: with the real ChunkSaveClass and ChunkLoadClass, Read returns 0 and old_obj is
	** NULL.  The remapping is not degraded on x64, it is entirely absent.
	**
	** Writing the pointer at its own width also puts this in line with how the rest of the engine
	** stores the same token - AudibleSoundClass saves VARID_THIS_PTR with WRITE_MICRO_CHUNK, which
	** is sizeof(the pointer variable), and reads it back with sizeof(old_ptr).  This template was
	** the only place that narrowed it.
	**
	** `obj` is a PersistClass *, and that is deliberate: Win32 wrote the bits of the PersistClass
	** subobject pointer, so keying on it preserves the behaviour that build had.  Under multiple
	** inheritance that address can differ from the T * Load() reads it into, which was equally
	** true before this change and is not introduced by it. */
