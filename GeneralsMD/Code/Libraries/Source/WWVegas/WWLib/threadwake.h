// threadwake.h: a worker thread asleep until it has work, or until it is told to leave.
//
// WW3D's texture loader thread looked at its queue and slept a millisecond (ThreadClass::Switch_Thread),
// for the whole session: about a thousand wakeups a second for a queue the shipped game never fills
// (textureloader.cpp).  A worker waits here instead, and whoever gives it work wakes it.  Header-only so
// every target that already builds WWLib's threads gets it without a new source in any list.
