** zh_fopen and its siblings: the C runtime's file calls, for code that opens files outside the
** engine's LocalFileSystem - the debug log, MemoryPools.ini, the preferences, the save and replay
** writers - many of which run before any file system exists (C1, decision D4).
**
** On Windows each one is the C runtime call it names, verbatim, and compiles to exactly what the
** call site compiled to before.
**
** Off Windows each one first hands the path to PosixPath_Resolve (posixpath.h), so the engine's
** spelling - backslashes, whatever case - reaches a file that exists in a different case on a
** case-sensitive volume.
**
** These are not shims in the MSVCCompat.h sense, which give a name Windows has its POSIX
** equivalent and change nothing else.  They add behaviour off Windows, and a call site that says
** zh_fopen says so; borrowing the standard names would hide it, and would also change every fopen in
** the tree, vendored code included.  Each keeps its own platform's C runtime semantics apart from the
** path: rename, for one, replaces an existing target on POSIX and fails on Windows, as it always has.
**
** Intent, off Windows: a call that can create its file - an fopen mode starting "w" or "a", an open
** with O_CREAT, the target of a rename, a new directory - needs the path's directories to exist and
** keeps the engine's spelling for a new last component; every other call needs the whole path to
** exist.
