** The one Direct3D 11 device and backend the process has, and the switch that asks for them.
**
** WW3D2 cannot see GlobalData, so -dx11 arrives the way -msaa and -ffshader do: pushed in from
** W3DDisplay::init before the device is made.  Asking for it is not the same as getting it - a
** machine with no Direct3D 11 driver and no WARP has neither - so Is_Active answers what actually
** happened rather than what was asked for, and everything that branches on the backend branches on
** that.
**
** The funnel is not finished while this is here: the engine still reaches the Direct3D 9 device
** past DX8Wrapper, and until those calls go through the wrapper a -dx11 run has a backend that
** only the wrapper's own state calls reach.
**
** Measured 2026-09-22 on 4b08cb58: 125 references to _Get_D3D_Device()/_Get_D3D() in
** GeneralsMD/Code, 89 of them outside dx8wrapper.{cpp,h}, which between them make 148 calls on the
** device - 47 straight through the accessor and 101 through a pointer captured into a local or a
** member first.  There are 22 DX8CALL sites outside the wrapper on top of that.
**
** This comment used to say 236, counted on 2026-09-09 by bfb60e17, which is the same measure taken
** before ef8303a9 removed 111 of them the same day.  docs/mac-port/D1-call-site-survey.md has the
** categories, the file list and the order the rest of them move in; re-measure rather than quoting
** either number.
**
** What the shutdown log reports - the refusal counters and the foreign shader list at the bottom
** of this header, written out by W3DDisplay - says how far that has got on any given run rather
** than leaving it to be guessed.  (An earlier draft of this comment named an Enable_Reports; there
** has never been one.)
