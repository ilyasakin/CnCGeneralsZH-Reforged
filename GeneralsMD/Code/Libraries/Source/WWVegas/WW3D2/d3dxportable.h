// The two D3DX functions that reach GameLogic, written out so that every machine computes them the
// same way.  d3dx9math.h routes both here on every platform, Windows included.
//
// BezierSegment and BezFwdIterator call D3DXVec4Transform and D3DXVec4Dot, and
// DumbProjectileBehavior flies a shell along the result, so this arithmetic is part of the replay
// and network CRC.  d3dx9math.h warns that "a hand-written 4x4 inverse or transform would be a
// rounding difference nobody could see until a replay diverged".  This file is that hand-written
// transform, so it is not written the way that reads best.  Its term order was taken from
// Microsoft's machine code.
//
// What the real DLL does, taken from d3dx9_43.dll x64, 9.29.952.3111 (June 2010 redistributable,
// sha256 84b900dbd7fa978d6e0caee26fc54f2f61d92c9c75d10b35f00e3e82cd1d67b4):
//
//   The export is a thunk through a function-pointer slot, and the slot is filled once, by CPU:
//
//     DisablePSGP / DisableD3DXPSGP = 1 under HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Direct3D,
//     or no SSE                                  scalar body, RVA 0x3efa0    ((a + b) + c) + d
//     CPUID vendor "GenuineIntel"                SSE body,    RVA 0x211e60   (a + b) + (c + d)
//     any other vendor                           SSE body,    RVA 0x2112c0   ((a + b) + c) + d
//
//   where a..d are x*m[0][j], y*m[1][j], z*m[2][j] and w*m[3][j].
//
// So the DLL does not have one term order.  It has two, and it chooses between them by the vendor
// of the processor.  The dispatch above was read out of the disassembly, not observed on a running
// Windows machine.  Each body's arithmetic was executed: Tests/d3dx_oracle runs Microsoft's own
// bytes for all three under Rosetta and compares them with this file.
//
// This file uses the left-to-right order, for three reasons:
//   - it is the SDK's reference C: the scalar body is what D3DX falls back to when its CPU-specific
//     paths are disabled;
//   - it is what every non-Intel x64 processor runs;
//   - it is what Wine's d3dx9 computes, so it is what a Mac player running the Windows build under
//     CrossOver computes today.
// It is bit-identical to the Intel path on every lane except x, the only lane where the Bezier
// basis has four nonzero terms.  There the two disagree on 46.8% of Tests/d3dx_oracle's inputs
// shaped like BezFwdIterator's, the ones a shell's flight is built from (35.7% over all its basis
// inputs, which include random-t vectors the game never evaluates).  While Windows took this function from the DLL, that was a defect of the shipping
// Windows game (docs/mac-port/README.md, defect #7), and no Mac build could match an Intel and an
// AMD Windows machine at once.  So Windows now uses this file too, and every machine sums in this
// order.
//
// Rules for anyone editing this file:
//   - Do not reassociate, fuse, vectorise by hand or "improve" either function.  The goal is
//     bit-identity with a DLL, not numerical quality.
//   - Compute into locals before writing, as all three DLL bodies do, so `out` may alias `vector`.
//   - The one thing C cannot pin is which NaN comes out when two operands are both NaN.  A NaN
//     here means the simulation has already diverged, so that is recorded rather than fought.
//
// Self-contained on purpose: floats only, no Windows types, and no Lib/BaseType.h (which would
// redefine NULL against WWLib's headers).  test_d3dxportable.cpp, the arch_diff probe and the DLL
// oracle all include this file directly, so each of them tests this code and not a copy of it.
