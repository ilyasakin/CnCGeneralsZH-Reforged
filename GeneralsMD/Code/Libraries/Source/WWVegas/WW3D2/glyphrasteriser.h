/*
 * GlyphRasteriserClass: what FontCharsClass asks GDI for, off Windows, from FreeType (decision 6, D6).
 *
 * FontCharsClass (render2dsentence.cpp) makes a GDI font with CreateFont, reads its TEXTMETRIC, and
 * for each character draws it with ExtTextOutW into a (2 x point size) square DIB and measures it with
 * GetTextExtentPoint32W.  On Windows it still does, unchanged.  Off Windows its twins ask this class
 * the same four questions, and the answers are meant to be GDI's for the same font file:
 *
 *   - Advances are the TrueType interpreter v35's, which takes the file's hdmx widths where it has
 *     them: the widths GDI uses (191 of 191 Latin-1 glyphs equal at every hdmx size of macOS's Arial,
 *     Arial Bold and Times New Roman; FreeType's default v40 moved whole strings by up to 230 px).  A
 *     width-scaled font ("Generals", CreateFont with an lfWidth) skips hdmx, as GDI does.
 *   - Heights are the file's VDMX table's, which GDI's tmAscent and tmDescent come from and FreeType
 *     does not read; the rounded usWin metrics without one.
 *   - Anti-aliasing follows the file's gasp table, as GDI's ANTIALIASED_QUALITY does, unless the one
 *     switch below says always grey.  Advances and heights never depend on the switch.
 *
 * Fonts: a file registered with Register_Font_File (Language.ini's LocalFontFile, what AddFontResource
 * installs on Windows) is found first, by its family name.  Otherwise the game's face name goes
 * through one substitution table: fixed files on macOS, Liberation through fontconfig on Linux.  No
 * Microsoft font is bundled.
 *
 * POSIX only; no Win32 types.  D6's task file has the measurements and what they cannot see.
