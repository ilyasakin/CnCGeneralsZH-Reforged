**     terrain.pso         lrp r0, v0.w, t1, t0 ; mul r0, r0, v0

**     roadnoise2.pso      mul r0, t0, t1 ; mul r0, r0, t2 ; mul r0, r0, v0
**
** lrp dest, a, b, c is c + a * (b - c), so v0.w weights the second layer over the first: that is
** the terrain blending one ground texture into the next by the alpha in its own vertices.  The road
