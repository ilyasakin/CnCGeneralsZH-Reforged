/* gdifontmetrics.h: the line metrics GDI gives the game's three Windows fonts, for glyphrasteriser.cpp
	 to use where it draws with a metric-compatible substitute instead (Linux: Liberation Sans, Serif and
	 Mono for Arial, Times New Roman and Courier New).  The substitutes match the advance widths and even
	 usWinAscent/usWinDescent, but have no VDMX, and GDI takes tmAscent and tmDescent from VDMX: without
	 this, 30 to 38 of the 43 sizes below come out 1 or 2 pixels shorter than on Windows (L1b).

	 WHAT THESE ARE: measured integers, TEXTMETRIC's tmAscent and tmDescent (tmHeight is their sum at
	 every size here), per pixel height.  No font data is included: no outlines, no hinting, no table
	 copied from a font file.

	 HOW THEY WERE MEASURED (2026-09-27, by a contributor): Tools/gdi-font-metrics.ps1 in a Windows VM, GDI itself:
	 CreateFont( -ppem, 0, 0, 0, FW_NORMAL or FW_BOLD, 0, 0, 0, DEFAULT_CHARSET, OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS,
	 CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS, ANTIALIASED_QUALITY, VARIABLE_PITCH, face ) - render2dsentence.cpp's own call -
	 selected into a memory DC, then GetTextMetrics.  GetTextFace confirmed each face; tmOverhang was 0 at
	 every size; the "Generals" lfWidth (0.40 x the height) changed no ascent or height.
	   Windows: Microsoft Windows 11 Pro build 26200.6584, LOGPIXELSY of the memory DC 96

	 Cross-checks: Arial at 13 px is 13 + 3 = 16, test_fontchars' number; and macOS's own Arial, Times
	 New Roman and Courier New (5.01 and alike, regular and bold), through glyphrasteriser.cpp's VDMX
	 rule, give the same ascent and height at all 43 sizes, so a Mac, which reads those files, needs none
	 of this. */
