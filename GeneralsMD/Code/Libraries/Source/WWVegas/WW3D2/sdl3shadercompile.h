/*
** A generated program on its way to SDL3's GPU API, off Windows (decision 4).
**
** The generators write HLSL for the SDL3_GPU target (sdl3target.h).  From there:
**
**   SDL3_Compile_HLSL_To_SPIRV   HLSL to SPIR-V, which is what SDL's Vulkan backend takes.  Today
**                                through glslang's HLSL front end.
**   SDL3_Translate_SPIRV_To_MSL  SPIR-V to MSL text, through SDL_shadercross (SPIRV-Cross), for
**                                checking and dumping.
**   SDL3_Create_Shader           the SDL_GPUShader for a device: the SPIR-V itself on Vulkan, MSL
**                                compiled by the driver on Metal, and on Direct3D 12 (-d3d12, X1)
**                                DXBC through SPIRV-Cross's HLSL and d3dcompiler_47.
**
** The first is the only place in the tree that names the HLSL front end, on purpose.  glslang has
** deprecated its HLSL front end (KhronosGroup/glslang#4210, removal not before about 2027-10), and
** decision 4 keeps a way out - DXC through SDL_shadercross, then Slang.  Taking it is this one
** function and its link line.  Everything that compiles a program, test_shader_sdl included, comes
** through here.
**
** POSIX only.  Windows compiles the D3D11 target with d3dcompiler_47.dll.
