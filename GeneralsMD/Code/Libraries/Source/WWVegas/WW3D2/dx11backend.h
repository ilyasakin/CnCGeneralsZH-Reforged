/*
** The Direct3D 11 renderer, driven the way the engine drives a Direct3D 9 device.
**
** The engine sets one thing at a time and then draws: a render state, a texture stage state, a
** texture, a transform, a stream, and eventually a DrawIndexedPrimitive.  Several hundred places
** do it and several thousand calls a frame come out of them, and rewriting those into something
** D3D11 shaped is not a phase, it is a different program.  (This said "236 places and 5600 calls"
** when it was written on 2026-09-09; the first number was a count of every mention of the device
** accessor in the sources, taken before ef8303a9 cut it by 45%, and the second was never a static
** count of anything.  docs/mac-port/D1-call-site-survey.md has the measurement that replaced it.)
** So this takes the calls as they are and resolves them at the
** moment of the draw, which is the only moment where everything needed to build a D3D11 pipeline is
** known at once.
**
** Resolving means five things.  The render states become the three state objects, the sampler
** states become sampler objects, the texture stage states become a pixel shader that ffshader
** generates, the lighting and transform states become a vertex shader that ffvertex generates, and
** the flexible vertex format becomes an input layout.  All five are cached on the description they
** came from, because the engine sets the same handful of combinations over and over: -ffprobe
** counted 42 distinct stage programs across four maps, and the state objects are fewer still.
**
** What this is not is a Direct3D 9 device.  It answers no COM interface, it is not handed to
** anything that expects one, and there is no D3D9 runtime underneath it: the calls have D3D9's
** names because the engine's calls have D3D9's names, and that is where the resemblance stops.
