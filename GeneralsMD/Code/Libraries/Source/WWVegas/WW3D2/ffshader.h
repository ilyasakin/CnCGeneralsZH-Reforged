** The fixed-function texture stages, written out as HLSL.
**
** D3D11 has no texture stage combiners, so the Direct3D 11 backend has to say in a shader
** what the stages were computing.  -ffprobe counted what the game actually asks for across four
** maps: 28 distinct combiner programs, never more than two stages, and a vocabulary of five
** operations over four arguments.  This turns one of those descriptions into the shader.
**
** It generates for D3D9 first, on purpose.  A pixel shader on the existing device can be compared
** against the fixed-function pipeline it replaces with tree-check.ps1, which turns the phase from
** one untestable port into a generator that is proved against the real game before any of it is
** carried to a second backend.  Fog and the alpha test are not generated for that reason: D3D9
** still applies both around a pixel shader, so leaving them alone keeps the comparison to the one
** thing being replaced.  D3D11 has neither and will want them here.
