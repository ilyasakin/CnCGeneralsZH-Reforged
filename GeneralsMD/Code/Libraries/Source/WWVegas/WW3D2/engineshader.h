** The engine's own shaders, rewritten as HLSL.
**
** ffvertex and ffshader generate a program out of fixed-function state.  Six draws a frame do not
** use fixed-function state at all: they load a shipped .vso or .pso out of the big archives and
** bind it, and the state that would describe them is not set.  Those are the last draws the
** Direct3D 11 backend refuses, and no generator can write them, because the program is the shipped
** bytecode and nothing else says what it does.
**
** So it is transcribed by hand, once, from the assembly d3d8shadertranslate hands back.  The .vso
** files ship compiled and their source is not in this tree; -dx11dump writes what the translator
** disassembled next to the generated programs, and that disassembly is what each function below is
** a line-for-line reading of.  The reading is written into the comment above each one so the next
** person can check it against the same dump rather than decoding vs_1_1 again.
**
** The output structure is ffvertex's, member for member.  Shader model 4 links the stages by slot
** in declaration order, so a program that writes a different set of members links against nothing
** the pixel half generates.
