/*
 * T1c's water grid scenario, shared by Tests/water_grid_oracle.cpp (the ORIGINAL code, stepped from the
 * render object's client-pass update) and Tests/test_water_grid.cpp (the moved code, stepped from the
 * top of each logic frame), so the two cannot drift.
 *
 * A 12 x 9 cell grid at rest at height 10.  Every third logic frame of the first half (the second is
 * left to settle, so the step's at-rest branch runs too) something pushes velocity into a
 * 3 x 3 box of points, as WaveGuideUpdate does through addWaterVelocity during a logic frame: the new
 * preferred height, the velocity added, the point marked in motion and the mesh marked moving - the
 * four things WaterRenderObjClass::addVelocity writes.  The box and the push change with the frame, so
 * the grid holds points at every stage from just pushed to settled.
 *
 * run() plays FRAMES logic frames through an Engine, grouped into passes as the schedule says: one
 * client pass, then that many logic frames, as GameEngine::update does (a schedule of all 1s is EA's
 * loop; anything larger is this fork's catch-up).  Per logic frame: the Engine's logicFrameTop, the
 * push, the frame counter moves on.  It returns one line: the hash of every point's bits after every
 * frame, the last frame's own hash, and how many of the frames ended with the mesh in motion.
 *
 * The gravity is the shipped one: GameData.ini's Gravity = -64.0, converted per logic frame as
 * INI::parseAccelerationReal does (test_water_grid checks that against the engine's own conversion).
