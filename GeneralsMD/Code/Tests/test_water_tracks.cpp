 * The .wak loader's two rules.  A map's .wak file sits beside it, and a network map transfer accepts
 * .wak, so what it says is not trusted: a wave type outside the wave table is skipped, and the track
 * count is capped by what the file holds.  Every shipped .wak (25, checked when this was written)
 * already obeys both, so the loader reads them as before.
