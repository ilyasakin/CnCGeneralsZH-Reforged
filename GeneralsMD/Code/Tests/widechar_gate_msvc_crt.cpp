// The half of MSVC's C runtime that widechar_crc_gate_msvc_model needs, and nothing more.
//
// -fshort-wchar makes wchar_t two bytes, as MSVC's is, but the C library on this machine was built
// with four-byte wchar_t.  UnicodeString.cpp calls wcslen, wcscpy, wcscat, wcsspn and wcscspn
// directly, and handing a two-byte string to a four-byte wcscpy overruns the heap: that is how
// this file was found, as a crash inside malloc.  So the Windows-model build defines those five
// here, over two-byte units, which is what MSVC's CRT does with them.  The executable's own
// definitions are the ones its objects link against, ahead of the C library's.
//
// Built ONLY into widechar_crc_gate_msvc_model.  It is the emulation of the Windows CRT the gate's
// (A) column relies on, and it is listed in the gate's header as such.  The C library's other wide
// functions that these objects name - fwprintf, vswprintf, vswscanf, all in WideCharFns.cpp's
// format funnel - are left alone because the hashing path never calls them; if it ever did, (A)
// would be wrong, and the gate's golden lines would stop matching the independent table.
