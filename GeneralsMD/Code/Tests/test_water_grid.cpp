/*
 * T1c, defect 17: the water grid steps once per logic frame, however many logic frames a pass runs.
 *
 * WaterGridMotion::updateForLogicFrame is the step moved out of WaterRenderObjClass::update; GameLogic::
 * update calls it (through TerrainVisual::updateWaterGrid) at the top of every logic frame.  This plays
 * Tests/water_grid_scenario.h through it that way, under EA's loop and three shapes of the fork's
 * catch-up, and requires every one to print what the ORIGINAL code printed under EA's loop.
 *
 * The golden is Tests/water_grid_oracle.cpp's first line: the original text, taken from 7b209198 by
 * Tools/water_grid_oracle_extract.py and stepped on the client pass as W3DTerrainVisual::update did,
 * one pass per logic frame.  Identical from mingw-w64 under Wine, native arm64 and x86_64 under Rosetta.
 * The armed control is the oracle's other lines: the original under the catch-up schedules below, which
 * all differ from it (and whose grid is still moving at frame 240, where EA's has settled by 183).
 *
 * What it cannot see: that GameLogic::update makes the call, and makes it at the top of the frame - that
 * is the engine's loop, which needs the W3D device to run (read in the source, T1's task file); the
 * client passes' own reads of the grid, which now see it a step earlier in a pass, and draw nothing
 * the simulation reads.
