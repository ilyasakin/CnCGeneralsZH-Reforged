#   1. nothing touched                              -> 0, "ok: the install is as it was"
#   2. one byte of a file changed, size and time kept -> 1, "THE INSTALL CHANGED" with that file named
#   3. the before-listing gone                      -> 2, "COULD NOT VERIFY", not "CHANGED"
#   4. the work folder gone, so the after-listing cannot be written (the 2026-09 false alarm)
#                                                   -> 2, "COULD NOT VERIFY", not "CHANGED"
