/*
 * FFReference's programmable stages (A3e): vs_1_1 and ps_1_1 programs, run from their ORIGINAL tokens.
 *
 * The same rule as FFReference: written from Microsoft's documentation alone - the shader reference pages
 * for what each instruction, register and modifier does (one page cited per instruction in ffprogram.cpp),
 * the driver pages "Instruction Token", "Destination Parameter Token" and "Source Parameter Token" for
 * the bit layouts.  It shares nothing with the game's own shader translation, which it exists to check.
 * The numbers the pages leave out (opcodes, register types, modifiers, version tokens) are values from
 * Microsoft's d3d8types.h, the header the reference pages name; they are written here as this file's own
 * constants, and Tools/ffprogram-values-check.sh static_asserts them against MinGW-w64's d3d8types.h.
 *
 * SCOPE: exactly what the game ships (the census, 2026-09-26: 16 programs in ShadersZH.big and
 * shaders.big, 4 ps.1.1 text programs in W3DWater.cpp).
 *   ps_1_1: tex, texbem, mov, mul, mad, add, dp3, lrp, def; registers r, v, c, t; the complement source
 *           modifier; the _x2 result shift; write masks; the alpha-replicate source swizzle; co-issue.
 *   vs_1_1: mov, add, mad, mul, dp4, m4x4, rcp; registers r, v, c (relative through a0.x), a0; the
 *           negate source modifier; any swizzle and write mask; outputs oPos, oD0, oD1, oT0-oT7.
 * Everything else is REFUSED by name when the program is decoded (Program::refusals), as FFReference
 * refuses the fixed-function states it does not model.
