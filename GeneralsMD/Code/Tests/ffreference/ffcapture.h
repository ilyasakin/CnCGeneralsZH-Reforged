/*
 * ffcapture: the device's draw captures, read for FFReference's own replay (L2's oracle side).
 *
 * INDEPENDENCE RECORD.  Written from a contributor's written descriptions of the capture format (v1, v2's .prog,
 * v3's D3D8 declaration; the descriptions are quoted in docs/mac-port/tasks/L2-vulkan-recon.md's
 * judging section) and from Microsoft's pages for D3DFVF, D3DFORMAT and the BC formats.  Its author did
 * not read the device's capture writer (PosixDevice9Capture.cpp), the harness's reader
 * (test_ffref_capture.cpp) or any other A3 code.  A disagreement between this reader and the writer is
 * a finding about the description.
 *
 * WHAT IT READS
 *   draw_NNNNN.cap  "ZHDC", version 1 (fixed function) or 2 (a .prog beside it); a 5132-byte header of
 *                   the draw's state, then VertexCount x Stride vertex bytes from the first vertex the
 *                   draw reads, then IndexCount u32 indices rebased to that vertex.
 *   NAME.tex        "ZHTX", D3DFORMAT, width, height, levels; per level a u32 byte count and the bytes.
 *   draw_NNNNN.prog "ZHPG", version 1 or 2: the vertex and pixel programs' tokens, the D3D9 elements,
 *                   the constants, and (2) the engine's D3D8 declaration and the streams.
 * Decoded here: the vertex format (D3DFVF), and the texture formats the captures hold (A8R8G8B8,
 * X8R8G8B8, R5G6B5, A4R4G4B4, A1R5G5B5, X1R5G5B5, A8, L8, A8L8, DXT1, DXT3, DXT5); others are refused
 * by name, never guessed.
