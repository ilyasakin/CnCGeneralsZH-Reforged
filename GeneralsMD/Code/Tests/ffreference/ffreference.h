/*
 * FFReference: Direct3D 9's fixed-function pipeline, computed in double precision on the CPU, from
 * Microsoft's documentation only (A3b, docs/mac-port/tasks/A-posix-d3d9-device.md, "A3 design").
 *
 * WHAT IT IS FOR.  An independent reading of the documented pipeline, so that A3's GPU fixed-function
 * programs can be compared against something that did not come from the same author or the same
 * code.  A3's harness hands it a draw's full state and vertices, it renders into a double-precision
 * target, and compare() classifies each GPU pixel against it.
 *
 * INDEPENDENCE RECORD.  Written from learn.microsoft.com's Direct3D 9 pages alone (each function in
 * ffreference.cpp names the page it follows).  Its author did not read ffshader.cpp, ffvertex.cpp,
 * the dx11 backend or A3's code while writing it, and did not work on them before.  Where the pages
 * are thin, the reading chosen is listed below under NAMED CHOICES, one line each, so that any
 * disagreement with the GPU side traces to one line: either a bug on one side, or a choice to revisit.
 *
 * CONVENTIONS
 *   - Matrices are D3D's: row vectors, v' = v * M, m[row][col], so _41.._43 hold a translation.
 *   - RASTER: D3D9's.  Pixel (x, y)'s centre is at integer screen coordinates (x, y), NOT D3D10's
 *     (x + 0.5, y + 0.5); the top-left fill rule decides centres exactly on an edge.  Texel (i, j)'s
 *     centre is at ((i + 0.5) / width, (j + 0.5) / height), row 0 at v = 0.
 *     ("Rasterization Rules", "Directly Mapping Texels to Pixels")
 *   - Screen mapping: X = vp.X + (1 + x/w) * vp.Width / 2, Y = vp.Y + (1 - y/w) * vp.Height / 2,
 *     Z = vp.MinZ + (z/w) * (vp.MaxZ - vp.MinZ).  ("Viewports and Clipping")
 *   - Clipping: homogeneous, before the divide, against 0 <= z <= w (and w > 0).  x and y are not
 *     clipped geometrically: pixels are limited to the viewport rectangle, which is the same set.
 *     ("Viewports and Clipping")
 *   - Colours are doubles 0..1.  A D3DCOLOR 0xAARRGGBB converts by / 255.
 *   - Textures arrive decoded (the harness decodes BC1-3 and the rest): level 0 is the largest, texels
 *     row-major from the top row.  A bump-map format (V8U8, X8L8V8U8) arrives SIGNED: du in r, dv in g,
 *     -1..1, and luminance in b, 0..1.  A format without alpha arrives with a = 1.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES: transform; lighting (directional, point, spot; material sources; local viewer);
 * vertex fog (linear, exp, exp2; depth or range) and table fog (z or w); texture-coordinate index and
 * generation (normal, position, reflection); texture transforms (count 1-4, projected); flat and
 * Gouraud shading; perspective-correct interpolation; 2D sampling with point/linear mag and min
 * filters, point/linear mip filters, LOD bias and MAXMIPLEVEL, all five address modes and the border
 * colour; the whole texture-stage cascade (D3DTOP 2-26, every D3DTA source and modifier, TEMP and
 * RESULTARG, the per-stage constant, bump mapping, premodulate); specular add; fog blend; alpha test;
 * depth (with bias) and stencil (one- and two-sided); scissor; alpha blending (every D3DBLEND and
 * D3DBLENDOP, separate alpha); colour write mask; the target's 8-bit quantisation.
 *
 * REFUSED (draw() returns false, Report::refusals says why, nothing is written):
 *   vertex or pixel shader bound; primitives other than triangle list/strip/fan; FILLMODE other than
 *   solid; SHADEMODE phong; VERTEXBLEND; user clip planes (CLIPPLANEENABLE != 0); w-buffering
 *   (ZENABLE = USEW); cube or volume textures at a stage the cascade reads; TCI SPHEREMAP (no page
 *   defines it); texture generation or TTFF on pretransformed (XYZRHW) vertices; MAG/MIN filter NONE,
 *   PYRAMIDALQUAD, GAUSSIANQUAD, CONVOLUTIONMONO, and ANISOTROPIC with MAXANISOTROPY > 1; sRGB reads or
 *   writes; D3DRS_WRAPn cylindrical wrapping; a colour-only D3DTOP used as ALPHAOP; RESULTARG other than CURRENT or
 *   TEMP; a stage reading D3DTA_TEXTURE with no texture bound, except the documented case of COLORARG1.
 *
 * NAMED CHOICES (where the pages are silent, contradictory, or image-only)
 *   N1  "Camera-Space Transformations" writes the directional light's camera direction as
 *       -norm(Dir * World * View) and a point light's vector as norm(V * Lp); both are read as the
 *       evident intent: -norm(Dir * View) (lights are in world space) and norm(Lp - V).
 *   N2  The spotlight and fog formulas are images; they are rebuilt from the variables the text names:
 *       spot = 1 if rho > cos(theta/2), 0 if rho <= cos(phi/2), else
 *       ((rho - cos(phi/2)) / (cos(theta/2) - cos(phi/2)))^falloff, rho = norm(Ldir_light).norm(V - Lp);
 *       fog linear (end - d)/(end - start), exp e^-(d*density), exp2 e^-(d*density)^2, clamped 0..1.
 *   N3  N.Ldir and N.H are clamped at 0 before use (a negative base has no real power).  Specular is
 *       not gated by N.Ldir: the page's formula has no gate.  pow(0, 0) = 1.
 *   N4  Per-light ambient (Atten * Spot * La) is included, as "Ambient Lighting" writes it.
 *   N5  With LIGHTING, the lit diffuse's alpha is the diffuse source's alpha and the lit specular's is
 *       the specular source's alpha; lit colours are clamped to 0..1 after summing all lights.
 *   N6  Lit specular is computed only with SPECULARENABLE ("Specular Lighting": "The default lighting
 *       state does not calculate specular highlights"); without it the lit specular's RGB is 0.  With
 *       it, it is added after the cascade (D3DRENDERSTATETYPE: "added to the base color after the
 *       texture cascade but before alpha blending"), RGB only, saturated.
 *   N7  An absent vertex diffuse or specular is 0xFFFFFFFF, as D3DTA writes for both.  (A reading of
 *       0 for specular was suggested; the page says 0xffffffff, so a disagreement is a finding.)
 *       COLORVERTEX with a material source naming a colour the vertex lacks uses the material's.
 *   N8  Vertex fog distance is |z| in camera space, or the camera-space distance with RANGEFOGENABLE.
 *       Table fog wins over vertex fog when both are set.  Table fog uses w (eye distance) unless the
 *       projection's fourth column is (0,0,0,1), then z/w before the viewport's MinZ/MaxZ scale.
 *       FOGENABLE with both modes NONE (and for pretransformed vertices without table fog) takes the
 *       fog factor from the specular alpha.  Linear fog with end == start gives 1 at d <= start, else 0.
 *   N9  Fog blends RGB only: f * C + (1 - f) * FOGCOLOR.  Order: cascade, specular add, fog, alpha
 *       test, stencil/depth, blend, write mask.
 *   N10 Colours, texture coordinates and the fog factor are all interpolated perspective-correct (by
 *       1/w); depth (Z) is interpolated linearly in screen space.
 *   N11 Flat shading takes diffuse and specular from the first vertex of each triangle (list 3i,
 *       strip i, fan i+1, per D3DSHADEMODE); fog is still interpolated.
 *   N12 Winding (for culling and two-sided stencil) is judged on screen, y down: clockwise means
 *       (x1-x0)(y2-y0) - (x2-x0)(y1-y0) > 0.  Odd triangles of a strip are taken as (i+1, i, i+2).
 *   N13 Texture-transform input padding: (u) -> (u, 1, 0, 0), (u, v) -> (u, v, 1, 0),
 *       (u, v, w) -> (u, v, w, 1); generated coordinates are (x, y, z, 1).  TTFF COUNTn keeps n
 *       elements; PROJECTED divides the first n-1 by the n-th.  Without TTFF the first two are used.
 *   N14 Reflection vector ("Cubic Environment Mapping"): R = 2(E.N)N - E with E = norm(-Vcamera) under
 *       LOCALVIEWER, else R = 2 Nz N - (0,0,1); the page's "world-space z of the vertex normal" is read
 *       as the camera-space normal's z, the formula's other N.  The normal is the one lighting uses.
 *   N15 LOD: lambda = log2(max(|d(uW,vH)/dx|, |d(uW,vH)/dy|)) + MIPMAPLODBIAS, from the exact screen
 *       derivatives.  The pages define no LOD at all ("Texture Filtering with Mipmaps": "Direct3D can
 *       assess which texture in a mipmap set is the closest resolution"), so this is the nominal only,
 *       and the envelope allows +-0.6 (Freedoms::lodDelta, F11, 2026-09-26): any footprint norm from
 *       L-infinity to L1 is within sqrt(2) of this L2 one, +-0.5 in log2, and 2x2 differencing adds
 *       ~0.1.  Apple's GPU measured +0.10 mean, +0.58 worst on x-stretched footprints (-a9's probe).
 *       lambda <= 0 magnifies.  MIPFILTER NONE uses level MAXMIPLEVEL; POINT the nearest level
 *       (round half up); LINEAR blends floor and floor+1; all clamped to [MAXMIPLEVEL, levels-1].
 *       ANISOTROPIC with MAXANISOTROPY <= 1 filters as LINEAR.  Bump offsets do not enter the LOD.
 *   N16 Every stage's result is saturated to 0..1.  Argument modifiers apply to all four components;
 *       ALPHAREPLICATE copies alpha into RGB, COMPLEMENT takes 1 - x (the two commute).
 *   N17 DOTPRODUCT3 reads its arguments as signed, 2x - 1, so the sum is 4 * sum((a-.5)(b-.5)), then
 *       saturates; as a COLOROP it also replaces the stage's alpha ("replicate the sum to all color
 *       channels, including alpha").  The page's DirectX 6/7 note (x - .5, RGB only) is not followed.
 *   N18 Triadic operations: MULTIPLYADD = ARG0 + ARG1 * ARG2, LERP = ARG0 * ARG1 + (1 - ARG0) * ARG2
 *       (the page's Arg1/Arg2/Arg3 read as COLORARG0/1/2).
 *   N19 Bump mapping: du' = du * M00 + dv * M10, dv' = du * M01 + dv * M11 (the formula is an image),
 *       added to the next stage's coordinates in normalised units; L' = clamp(L * scale + offset, 0, 1)
 *       multiplies the next stage's texture RGB.  The bump stage passes CURRENT through (D3DTA_CURRENT).
 *   N20 A stage whose COLORARG1 is D3DTA_TEXTURE with no texture bound ends the cascade there.  With
 *       stage 0 disabled the cascade's result is the diffuse colour.  The result is CURRENT after the
 *       last enabled stage, whatever RESULTARG the last stage used.
 *   N21 Alpha test compares the pixel's alpha against ALPHAREF / 255 (low 8 bits), unrounded.
 *   N22 Depth bias: Z += DEPTHBIAS + SLOPESCALEDEPTHBIAS * max(|dZ/dX|, |dZ/dY|), in the 0..1 depth
 *       units of the z-buffer, then clamped to 0..1.  ZENABLE FALSE disables the test and the write.
 *   N23 D3DBLEND_BOTHSRCALPHA / BOTHINVSRCALPHA as SRCBLEND override DESTBLEND (and likewise for the
 *       separate alpha factors).  MIN and MAX ignore the factors.  The blend result is clamped to 0..1.
 *       A target without alpha reads destination alpha as 1.
 *   N24 Writes to an 8-bit target round to the nearest level.  DITHERENABLE is ignored.
 *   N25 Pretransformed (XYZRHW) vertices are not clipped geometrically: pixels whose Z falls outside
 *       0..1 are discarded, and the pixels are limited to the viewport like any other.
 *   N26 D3DTOP_PREMODULATE: stage n outputs ARG1; if stage n+1 has a texture, every D3DTA_CURRENT that
 *       stage n+1 reads is first multiplied by stage n+1's texture colour (the page's wording).
 *   N27 The halfway vector without LOCALVIEWER is norm((0,0,1) + Ldir), as "Specular Lighting" writes it
 *       (with it, norm(norm(-Vcamera) + Ldir)).
 *   N28 A stage whose TEXCOORDINDEX names a coordinate set the vertices lack reads u, v = (0, 0)
 *       (D3DTSS_TEXCOORDINDEX: "the system defaults to the u and v coordinates (0,0)"); the page names
 *       no third or fourth component, so the set is padded as any 2-component set is (N13).
 *   N29 ALPHAOP DISABLE under an enabled COLOROP is "undefined behavior" (D3DTEXTUREOP, D3DTOP_DISABLE),
 *       and the game does it.  It is drawn rather than refused: that stage's alpha is unconstrained, with
 *       CURRENT's alpha passed through as the nominal and 0 and 1 as the envelope's variants.  Every
 *       later use of alpha - an operation, the alpha test, the blend - is linear or a threshold in it,
 *       so the two extremes bound what any value could give.  The pixels it moves carry ZONE_UNDEFINED.
 *   N30 Where the alpha test is undecided (ZONE_ALPHA_TEST: some variant passes, some fails), the colour
 *       that may be written is bounded by every variant's colour, passing or not.  The variants are
 *       points in a continuous freedom, and colour and alpha move together between them, so the pass
 *       boundary can fall between a failing and a passing variant with a colour on the way from one to
 *       the other - beyond every passing variant's when the texture's colour falls as its alpha rises
 *       (foliage over a bright ground).  Found on the game's own alpha-tested draws (-a9's C2, 2026-09-26).
