# The INI masters' line ends and the multiplayer INI CRC. INI::readLine turns each carriage return into a
# space and folds the line into the CRC, so an LF copy of the masters gives another INI CRC than the CRLF
# copy a Windows checkout has, and a Mac or Linux build made from it could not join a Windows player's
# game. .gitattributes checks the masters out CRLF everywhere, and Tools/stage-overlay.sh writes them CRLF
# whatever the checkout holds. Checked here:
#   1. without game data: the overlay staged from an LF copy of Code/Data and from a CRLF copy holds the
#      same Data/INI bytes, and every line of every one ends in CRLF;
#   2. with game data: the game logs the same INI CRC from both overlays, and the armed control, the LF
#      overlay as a build made it before the fix, gives another.
# RULE 9: the game runs on a farm of the install (a folder of links), never on the install, which is
# listed before and after and must be unchanged (Tools/install-guard.sh).
# Usage: run_ini_crlf_check.sh <generals> [<folder holding zerohour/>]   (ZH_DATA_DIR otherwise)
# Exit status: 0 passed; 1 failed; 77 when part 2 had no game data (part 1 passed).
