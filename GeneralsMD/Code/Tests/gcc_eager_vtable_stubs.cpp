/* The engine symbols that GCC makes a self-check name, and that the self-check never calls.

	 WHY THEY ARE NAMED.  GameMemory.h:914 is `#define EMPTY_DTOR(CLASS) inline CLASS::~CLASS() { }`.
	 The destructor is declared in the class and defined inline OUTSIDE it, so under the Itanium ABI it
	 is still the class's key function, and GCC emits the vtable - and with it the deleting destructor,
	 operator delete and getClassMemoryPool - in every translation unit that sees that definition:
	 every TU that includes PreRTS.h.  Clang demotes a key function that is later defined inline, and
	 when optimizing emits none of it - but not always at -O0: Ubuntu 24.04's clang 18 at -O0 emitted
	 six such vtables and 22 undefined references from one engine TU, at -O2 none (measured).  Under
	 GCC one engine TU linked on its own needs the memory pool, the string buffers and AudioEventRTS.
	 Measured on Ubuntu 24.04's GCC 13, Release: FPUControl.cpp.o alone carries the vtables of
	 Bucket, Overridable, ScienceInfo and DynamicAudioEventRTS.  -Wl,--gc-sections does not help, because GNU ld
	 reports undefined references before it collects sections.

	 WHO LINKS THIS.  The self-checks that build a few real engine TUs without gameengine:
	 fpucontrol_selfcheck and widechar_crc_gate (both twins).  Each symbol here is one that some such
	 TU names and none of them runs.  If one ever runs, it says which and aborts: a failing test, never
	 garbage.  A new header-inline dependency shows up as a link error naming the symbol, and belongs
	 here.

	 AsciiString::freeBytes and UnicodeString::releaseBuffer are here for the targets that do NOT link
	 the real AsciiString.cpp and UnicodeString.cpp.  The widechar gate does, so it compiles this file
	 without ZH_EAGER_VTABLE_STUB_STRINGS; fpucontrol_selfcheck defines it.

	 WHEN IT GOES.  When gameengine links on Linux, these tests can link it instead, and this file
	 should be deleted, not extended. */
