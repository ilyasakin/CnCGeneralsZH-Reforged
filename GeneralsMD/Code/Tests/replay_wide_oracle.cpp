/*
 * replay_wide_oracle - what the Windows C runtime's wide stream calls put on disk in a replay header,
 * for test_widechar_file.cpp's expected bytes (C1, PR (g)).  Windows only: built with mingw-w64 and
 * run under Wine, or on Windows.  It writes exactly as Recorder.cpp did before PR (g) - fwprintf with
 * "%ls" and fputwc, mixed with fwrite and fprintf on one FILE* opened "wb" - then reads it back as the
 * replay reader did, with fread and fgetwc on "rb", and prints both as hex.
 *
 *   replay_wide_oracle <scratch file>
 *
 * Build with -D__USE_MINGW_ANSI_STDIO=0, so fwprintf is the C runtime's own and not mingw's.
