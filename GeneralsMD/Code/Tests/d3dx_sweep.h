// One deterministic sweep of D3DXVec4Transform inputs, shared by two harnesses so that their
// results can be chained:
//
//   Tests/d3dx_oracle   Microsoft's DLL bodies == d3dxportable.h built for x86_64, over this sweep
//   Tests/arch_diff     d3dxportable.h on x86_64 == d3dxportable.h on arm64, over this sweep
//                       (as a fingerprint)
//
// Together they say that on these inputs, the arm64 build computes what the DLL's scalar and
// non-Intel bodies compute.  That only holds if both use the same inputs, which is why the inputs
// live here and not in either harness.
//
// Every input is built from integers by exact operations or by assembling bit patterns: no libc
// rand() and no transcendental, so the sweep is the same sequence on every platform and compiler.
