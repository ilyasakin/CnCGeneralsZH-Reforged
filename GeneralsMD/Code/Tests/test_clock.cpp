/*
 * Lib/Clock.h - the two questions the engine asks a clock.
 *
 * What is worth pinning here is not "does it return a number".  It is the three
 * properties the 462 call sites B2 moved depend on, each of which would fail
 * silently rather than loudly if a future implementation got it wrong:
 *
 *   - the millisecond clocks are 32 bits wide, because interval arithmetic in
 *     this engine relies on their wrap (SysTimeClass::Reset writes
 *     `WrapAdd = 0 - StartTime`, which is only correct in 32-bit unsigned);
 *   - all of them go forwards and none of them goes backwards;
 *   - the tick clock and its rate describe the same clock, so that
 *     (later - earlier) / rate is a duration and not a number.
 *
 * This runs on macOS today, which is the point: the Windows half of the header
 * is a one-line forward to the call that was already there, and the macOS half
 * is the part nobody has ever run.
