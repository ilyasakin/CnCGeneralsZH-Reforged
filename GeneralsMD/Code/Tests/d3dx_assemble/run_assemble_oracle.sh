# A3e-asm: Microsoft's own D3DXAssembleShader against FFReference's ps.1.1 assembler, on the game's four
# water programs.  assemble_oracle.cpp explains the mechanism and its one departure (three C-runtime
# sites that read the Windows thread block); this file says what it is worth.
#
# =============================================================================================
# WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
#
# It proves: for each ps.1.1 text W3DWater.cpp hands D3DXAssembleShader, the June 2010 d3dx9_43 x64
# (with the D3DCompiler_43 it loads, as on Windows) emits exactly the tokens FFRef::assemblePixelProgram
# emits, word for word, and they decode under FFReference's census.  So what a Windows machine's D3DX
# makes of those texts is pinned, and the oracle's second reading of them agrees.
#
# It does NOT prove:
#   - What the port hands its device.  The port's D3DXAssembleShader is not an assembler: it carries
#     the text to the device in a comment (decision: it stays so; the device picks a transcription by
#     the registered name).  test_ffprogram's stub check pins that the text arrives exactly.
#   - Anything about other D3DX builds.  Both DLLs are sha256-pinned; the patched sites are this
#     build's.
#   - Behaviour on error paths.  Every import the DLLs never called here is a trap, and exceptions
#     stop the run.  Valid text only.
# =============================================================================================
#
# Needs Microsoft's DLLs, which this repository does not and should not carry.  Every Steam install of
# the game ships both cabs, in _CommonRedist/DirectX/Jun2010/:
#
#   ZH_D3DX9_X64=/path/to/Jun2010_d3dx9_43_x64.cab ctest -R d3dx_assemble_oracle --output-on-failure
#   (Jun2010_D3DCompiler_43_x64.cab is taken from beside it, or from ZH_D3DCOMPILER_X64)
#
# Skips (77) without them, or without an x86_64 toolchain and Rosetta.  Refuses a Wine builtin and any
# DLL whose sha256 is not the pinned one.
