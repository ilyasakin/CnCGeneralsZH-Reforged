# The load-time module checks, one short run for both:
#   #33: no override may leave a unit without the locomotors EA gave it;
#   #34: no ObjectReskin may end up without a behaviour module its source has.
#
# An object's "Locomotor = SET_..." lines are stored in its AI module's data, so a ReplaceModule of that
# module discards them unless the block re-states them. Upstream's fbe8dc6f and 179e1f65 did that to 12
# units (three Chinooks, three Humvees, three ECM tanks, three Nuke Cannons), and the first Chinook a
# Supply Center made crashed every platform. ThingTemplate::parseReplaceModule records what a replacement
# discards, and ThingFactory's checkLocomotors logs, once everything has loaded:
#   LocomotorCheck: <name> lost its <n> locomotor set(s) to a ReplaceModule of its AI module, ...
#   LocomotorCheck: <r> things had an AI module with locomotors replaced, <m> of them left without a SET_NORMAL
# And (#34) a reskin copies its source's modules; a module added to one in a normal INI load used to erase
# every copied module sharing an interface with it (upstream's fbe8dc6f left the Demolition General's
# Technical reskins with no AI, and the first AI that recruited one crashed). ThingFactory's checkReskins logs
#   ReskinCheck: <name> lacks behaviour modules its source <source> has: ...
#   ReskinCheck: <r> reskins, <m> of them lacking a behaviour module their source has
# This loads the shipped data and the overlay through the game itself (one 30-frame run of
# Tools/replay-check.sh, rule 9 as ever) and requires both summary lines, with m = 0 and no "lost" or
# "lacks" line.
# replay-check's own verdict is not this test's: 30 frames is an idle match, which it rightly calls IDLE.
#
# WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE: a unit that loses a locomotor some other way (a RemoveModule of its AI module, or
# an override that re-states the wrong locomotor); a locomotor set other than SET_NORMAL that a
# replacement drops while SET_NORMAL is re-stated (reported in the count of replacements, not failed);
# and a map's own map.ini overrides, which load with the map, not here.
#
# Needs ZH_DATA_DIR (a folder holding zerohour/); without it, exit 77, which ctest reports as Skipped.
# Usage: run_locomotor_check.sh <generals>
