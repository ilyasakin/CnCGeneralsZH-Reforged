/* fpucontrol_selfcheck: after setFPMode(), floating point behaves as it does under Windows' default
	 MXCSR - round to nearest, denormals produced and read as themselves, NaN payloads propagated.

	 ARMED.  Before calling setFPMode it puts the environment where setFPMode must undo it - round
	 upward, and flush-to-zero plus default-NaN (arm64 FPCR FZ and DN; x86-64 MXCSR FTZ and DAZ) - and
	 runs every check once WITHOUT setFPMode, requiring each group to fail.  A check that passes in that
	 state could not see what it is checking, and the test fails.  Then setFPMode, and everything must
	 pass.

	 Exact bits, not tolerances: FLT_MIN * 0.5 is exactly 0x00400000, a denormal; the smallest denormal
	 times two is exactly 0x00000002; a quiet NaN with payload 0x123 plus one is itself; 1 + 2^-24
	 rounds to even, to 1.

	 What it does NOT establish: that two machines compute the same simulation.  This is the control
	 register's state, measured through arithmetic, on this machine only.  And one thing is different
	 by architecture and cannot be set: the NaN that an invalid operation GENERATES (0/0) is 0xFFC00000
	 on x86 (Windows included) and 0x7FC00000 on arm64, whatever FPCR says.  That is pinned below per
	 architecture so a change is noticed; whether any NaN's bits reach a CRC or a save is a separate
	 question (docs/mac-port/tasks/B5-win32-types.md). */

/* FPUControl.h alone, not PreRTS.h: the engine headers define key functions inline outside their
	 classes (GameMemory.h's EMPTY_DTOR), and GCC emits those classes' vtables in every TU that sees
	 them, which then need the engine's out-of-line pieces (AudioEventRTS, MemoryPool) that this
	 self-check does not link.  Clang does not when optimizing, which is why macOS never noticed;
	 Linux/gcc did.  (Clang at -O0 can: see the stub file.)
	 FPUControl.cpp itself must include PreRTS.h, so it names them anyway: they are stubbed, to abort
	 if ever called, in Tests/gcc_eager_vtable_stubs.cpp. */
