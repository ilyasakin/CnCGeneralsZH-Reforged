// d3dxportable.h has to compute what d3dx9_43.dll computes, bit for bit, because
// DumbProjectileBehavior flies a shell along its output and the flight is in the CRC.
//
// The expected values are absolute and were not produced by this repository.  d3dx_golden.h holds
// outputs of Microsoft's own machine code, and Tests/d3dx_oracle re-derives them from the DLL
// whenever one is supplied.  So this is not a check that two copies of the same arithmetic agree.
//
// Links nothing and needs no DLL, so it runs on every build.
//
// WHAT THIS DOES NOT PROVE:
//   - Which DLL body a Windows player gets.  The DLL chooses by CPU vendor.  This matches the
//     scalar and non-Intel bodies and deliberately NOT the GenuineIntel one; see d3dxportable.h.
//     A pass here is a statement about those bodies, not about "Windows".
//   - Anything about MSVC.  The DLL's bytes are fixed, but on Windows the game does not use this
//     file.  It binds the DLL.
//   - Every input.  These are fifteen rows.  The oracle sweeps millions when the DLL is present,
//     and that is the stronger check.  Without the DLL, this table is all there is.
//   - The architectures against each other.  That is Tests/arch_diff's d3dx section.
//   - The game's own call sites.  BezierSegment.cpp and BezFwdIterator.cpp cannot compile on
//     macOS yet (PreRTS.h needs atlbase.h), so the arithmetic is pinned here and not yet
//     exercised through BezFwdIterator.
