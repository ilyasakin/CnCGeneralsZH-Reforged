/* Strings built before main, by a static constructor, before anything has started the memory
	 manager: the real AsciiString.cpp, UnicodeString.cpp and GameMemory.cpp.

	 The engine has such constructors - LogClass objects at file scope (WOLLobbyMenu.cpp,
	 WOLQuickMatchMenu.cpp, PeerThread.cpp) build an AsciiString - and on macOS the process died in
	 one with EXC_BAD_ACCESS: the strings allocate from TheDynamicMemoryAllocator directly, which is
	 NULL until something starts the memory manager, and on Windows that something is whichever static
	 constructor happens to call operator new first.  The strings now start it themselves, as operator
	 new does.  Here nothing else can have: this file's constructor is the only one that allocates.

	 Whichever string is built first starts the memory manager, so the test is built twice:
	 test_premain_strings builds the AsciiString first, test_premain_unicode (ZH_PREMAIN_UNICODE_FIRST)
	 the UnicodeString.  A crash is the test failing: ctest reports the signal. */
