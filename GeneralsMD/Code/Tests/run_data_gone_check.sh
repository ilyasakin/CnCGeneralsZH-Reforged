# The game's data going away under it (README's latent list: the lid-close crash).  A player whose install
# is on a drive that is disconnected, ejected or asleep: the archives are open, and the next read of one
# fails.  The game must say so and stop - exit status 3 (GAME_DATA_GONE_EXIT_STATUS, Common/Debug.h), the
# "GAME DATA GONE" line in its log - and never crash.
#   1. The two window archives (WindowZH.big, ZH_Generals/Window.big) are copied onto a disk image of the
#      test's own, and the farm's links for them point there.  A headless skirmish is stopped (SIGSTOP)
#      mid-match, the image is detached, the game continued: its next archive read (a window layout, when
#      the match ends, after its HEADLESS RESULT line) fails with EIO.  Expected: exit 3, the line, no crash
#      report.
#   2. The control: the same, with the copies in a plain folder that is renamed away instead.  A rename
#      leaves an open file readable, so the game must play on and end normally: the detection keys on the
#      device being gone, not on anything that changed under the game.
#
# RULE 9: the game never runs with the real install as its root.  The root is a farm of links into it; the
# two links this test repoints are removed first (rm -f), never written through.  The install is listed
# before the farm is built and checked at the end (Tools/install-guard.sh).  Only the image this test
# attached is ever detached, by the device its own attach reported, and only while it is still mounted
# where the test put it.
#
# Platforms: macOS (hdiutil).  Elsewhere it exits 77, which ctest reports as Skipped.  The two steps that
# differ are attach_image and detach_image; Windows can take a VHD there (diskpart create/attach/detach
# vdisk), which would measure the Windows error codes LocalFile.cpp names but has not seen.
# Needs ZH_DATA_DIR (a folder holding zerohour/); without it, exit 77.
# Usage: run_data_gone_check.sh <generals>
