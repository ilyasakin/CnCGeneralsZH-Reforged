# stages everything else. Made-up Code/Data and Run folders; no game data.
#   1. ShowHudOverlay = Yes, and a commented-out No       -> staged
#   2. a loose Data/INI/GameData.ini with "ShowHudOverlay = No" -> refused, exit 1, nothing left behind
#   3. the same line in a Reforged*.big the overlay links  -> refused
#   4. "ShowHudOverlay = 0" and "= false", in any case     -> refused
