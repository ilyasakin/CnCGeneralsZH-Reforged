// Desc:   CreateCDManager off Windows: a CD manager that finds no drives.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* Win32CDManager asks GetDriveType of every drive letter and adds each CD-ROM it finds.  There are no
	 drive letters here, and the game is played from an installed copy, so this finds none: the same
	 answer a Windows PC without an optical drive gets, which is every Steam install.  FileSystem asks
	 it whether the music is on a disc (no), and GameEngine updates it every frame (CDManager::update
	 refreshes an empty list).  createDrive is only reached through newDrive, which only Win32CDManager
	 calls, so reaching it here is a bug. */
