/* What D3D9's device and D3DX do to surfaces on the CPU, over PosixImage:

	 - posixCopyImage: a rectangle of one image into a rectangle of another, converting the format and
		 scaling as asked.  A copy of the same format and size is a straight byte copy of whole blocks, so
		 compressed data is moved, never decoded.  Anything else goes through PosixPixelCodec, and fails
		 where it cannot write the destination's format (compressing to DXT).
	 - The filters are D3DX's names for what they do: NONE copies without scaling and leaves what the
		 source does not cover transparent black; POINT takes the nearest pixel; LINEAR interpolates
		 between the four nearest; BOX and TRIANGLE average the source pixels each destination pixel
		 covers (for the 2:1 reductions mip chains are made of, TRIANGLE and BOX agree).
	 - posixFillImage and posixFillDepth: ColorFill, and Clear's colour and depth. */
