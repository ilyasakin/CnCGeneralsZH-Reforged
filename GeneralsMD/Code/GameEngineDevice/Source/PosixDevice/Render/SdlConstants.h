/*
** The constants a generated program reads (decision 7, phase A3c), pushed with SDL_PushGPUVertexUniformData
** and SDL_PushGPUFragmentUniformData at slot 0.  Laid out as the generators declare their blocks
** (ffvertex.cpp's `cbuffer VertexPipeline`, ffshader.cpp's `cbuffer CombinerConstants`), which is
** dx11backend's VertexConstantBlock and the first three fields of its PixelConstantBlock: a program
** declares a prefix of its block, and a longer push is legal.  Every field is a float4 or a row-major
** float4x4, so HLSL's packing and std140, which SDL3 asks for, agree.
**
** The pixel block stops after the alpha reference: the fields after it serve the Direct3D 11 backend's
** own additions (normal maps, the shadow map, the sky), which A3 does not draw - A3 draws the Direct 3D 9
** picture.
