** The generated programs on SDL3 GPU (decision 7, phase A3c): a description to D3's generator (target
** SDL3_GPU), its HLSL through glslang to SPIR-V and on to what the device takes (sdl3shadercompile), and
** the result kept by D3's key for the description.
**
** Each program carries its binding table: how many texture-sampler slots and uniform buffers it binds
** (SDL3_Shader_Slots), and which texture and which sampler state each slot takes - slot n is stage n's
** texture with stage n's sampler state unless the program's "// SDL3 slot N: texture tT, sampler state
** sS" lines say otherwise (sdl3target.h).
**
** A description the generator refuses, or a program the compiler or the device refuses, is kept too,
** as a refusal with its reason, so it is tried once and counted every time (the design's rule: refused,
** never approximated).
