// Desc:   Pixels of Direct3D 9's formats to and from RGBA, for the copies, fills and filters that
//         D3D9 and D3DX do on the CPU (decision 7, phase A2).
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

/* One colour is four floats, red, green, blue and alpha, in 0..1.  A format's channels are read as
	 D3D9 defines them: a missing colour channel reads as 1 for X formats' unused bits and as the
	 luminance for L formats, a missing alpha reads as 1.  Writing drops what a format cannot hold,
	 rounding to nearest.

	 Decoding covers every colour format a texture or surface of the game's is made in, and DXT1-5.
	 Encoding covers the uncompressed ones only.  Writing DXT is compression, which nothing has asked for
	 yet: posixCanEncode says so, and the callers fail the call rather than write something else. */
