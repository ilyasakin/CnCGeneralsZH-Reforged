/*
** A captured draw (decision 7, A3's DONE: "every pipeline key checked").  With ZH_GPU_CAPTURE=<dir> the
** device writes the first draw of every distinct signature - the vertex program's key, the pixel
** program's and the pipeline's - with everything a replay needs to draw it again: the state as set, the
** vertices and indices it reads, and its textures.  test_ffref_capture replays each through the device on
** the GPU and through FFReference, and compares.
**
** What a capture does not hold: the target's pixels, depth and stencil before the draw.  A replay draws
** into a cleared target, so a draw that depends on what was under it (EQUAL depth, a stencil test,
** blending onto the frame) is checked against the clear, not against the frame.
**
** Version 1 skips a draw that samples a render target: its texels are the GPU's, and reading them back
** at the draw would flush the batch.  The writer counts what it skipped and why.
**
** Captures come from the user's install: they are written to a scratch directory and never committed.
** The files are raw structs of this build, not an interchange format - the same build writes and reads them.
**
**   <dir>/draw_<n>.cap      a DrawCaptureHeader, then vertex_count * stride vertex bytes, then index_count
**                            uint32_t indices (0 for a non-indexed draw), rebased to the first vertex stored
**   <dir>/<name>.tex        a DrawCaptureTexture, then each level's rows, packed, as the texture holds them;
**                            one file per texture content, shared by every capture that samples it
**   <dir>/draw_<n>.prog     version 2 only: "ZHPG", u32 1; the vertex section - u32 present, and if
**                            present char[64] registered name, u32 token count and the tokens as the device
**                            received them; then u32 element count and the bound declaration's elements,
**                            8 bytes each (u16 stream, u16 offset, u8 type, method, usage, usage index); the
**                            pixel section - u32 present, and if present its name, count and tokens; then
**                            f32 c0-c95 of the vertex shader constants and c0-c7 of the pixel ones, 4 each.
**                            Written from the description sent to a contributor (who reads no code of this).
