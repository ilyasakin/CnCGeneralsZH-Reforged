/*
** GPU copies of A2's textures and buffers (decision 7, phase A3c; tasks/A-posix-d3d9-device.md,
** "Resources on the GPU").  A copy is made the first time a draw needs it, and brought up to date
** whenever a draw finds the A2 object's version() moved.
**
** What a draw sees is what D3D9 would have shown it.  A copy's new bytes are taken when the draw that
** needs them is recorded, and the batch's copy pass uploads them before any of the batch's draws.  So a
** copy that a draw of this batch has already used, and that changes again, flushes the batch first:
** otherwise the earlier draw would see the later bytes.  Those flushes are counted, since they should be
** rare: the engine writes its dynamic buffers, which draws copy into the staging stream instead, and
** loads its textures once.
**
** Texture formats: DXT1, DXT2/3 and DXT4/5 go up as BC1, BC2 and BC3 where the GPU samples them, and
** A8R8G8B8 as B8G8R8A8, byte for byte.  Everything else is expanded to B8G8R8A8 with A2's codec, since
** SDL3 GPU has no swizzle: X8R8G8B8 must read alpha 1, the luminance formats replicate it.
**
** A2 objects die on whatever thread drops them (posixResourceDestroyed): their copies leave the table
** under a mutex at once, and are handed to the frame to release after the batch, on the main thread.
