// PosixInstallRoot.h: where the player's Zero Hour is (P1 step 4).

/* The game's data is the player's own install (Steam, CD, First Decade, a copy from a PC), anywhere
	 on disk; off Windows no path can be assumed.  PosixMain asks here, before the engine exists:

	   1. "-root <dir>": used as given, never validated (harnesses root at farms and test folders);
	   2. Registry.ini's Zero Hour InstallPath, if it still validates (an install can move);
	   3. packaged only (an app bundle, or a Linux package, P3): the known places (~/Games, /Applications,
	      the Steam libraries, CrossOver and Whisky bottles), the first that validates;
	   4. packaged only: the player's own choice, through the chooser PosixMain passes (SDL's native
	      folder dialog; none in the Steam Deck's Game Mode, which is told to use -root instead).  An
	      invalid choice is said why and asked again; cancelling ends the start.  The chosen folder is
	      the one thing written: Registry.ini's InstallPath, so the chooser runs once;
	   5. unpackaged: the executable's directory, as always.

	 Validation: Zero Hour's INIZH.big at the folder's top level, and the base game's Textures.big found
	 where Win32BIGFileSystem::init will look for it (the folder itself, ZH_Generals/, the two sibling
	 folder names, or Registry.ini's Generals InstallPath and its First Decade subfolder); and not a
	 folder inside the app bundle or an overlay.  Everything here is plain logic over the file system,
	 so every path but the dialog itself is tested (test_install_root). */
