// PosixGameEngine: the platform half of the game engine off Windows (C1 (f)), shared by macOS and
// Linux.  Win32GameEngine's counterpart for what is the platform's and not the renderer's:
//   - the file systems: PosixLocalFileSystem, and the BIG archive reader Windows uses (built here
//     from Win32Device's own source, so both platforms mount archives in the same order);
//   - the network, as NetworkInterface::createNetwork() on Windows;
//   - no embedded browser: nothing creates one on Windows either (WebBrowserPosix.cpp).
//
// Deliberately abstract.  The factories Windows answers with W3DDevice classes - game logic, game
// client, module factory, thing factory, function lexicon, particle system manager, radar - and the
// audio manager stay pure virtual here, for the subclass that has a renderer to give: C2's
// SdlGameEngine answers them with the same W3D classes Win32GameEngine does (decision 8), W3DDevice
// being built off Windows since decision 7's A1.
// serviceWindowsOS is empty: the event pump is C2's, in the subclass.  CreateGameEngine is C2's too.
