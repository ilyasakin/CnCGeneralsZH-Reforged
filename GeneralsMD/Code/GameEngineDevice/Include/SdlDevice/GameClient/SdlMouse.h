// SdlMouse.h: the mouse off Windows, from SDL3's mouse events (C3, decision 3).
//
// Win32Mouse's counterpart, and meant to be read beside it: the same ring of events the window
// procedure fills (here SdlInput_dispatch), the same translation into MouseIO, the same update() that
// asks where the pointer really is until an event says, and the same confinement of the pointer to a
// window that covers the screen.  The differences, each on purpose:
//   - Positions are in the game's pixels: SDL's are the window's points, which differ on a Retina
//     screen and whenever the window is not the game's resolution.
//   - A double click is SDL's click count - the system's own interval and distance - with an even
//     count reported as MBS_DoubleClick and an odd one as a press, which is the sequence Windows sends
//     (down, up, double, up; a third click is a down again).
//   - The wheel is SDL's y at 120 a notch, fractions carried to the next event, so a trackpad's small
//     steps arrive the way a precision touchpad's small WM_MOUSEWHEEL deltas do.  The user's
//     natural-scrolling setting is left as SDL reports it.
//   - SDL captures the mouse while a button is down, so a release outside the window still arrives
//     (Windows' game never called SetCapture and lost it: a stuck drag).  Such positions are held to
//     the window's edge, the range the engine always saw.
// The cursors: RM_WINDOWS's Data/Cursors/*.ANI files, decoded by AniCursor into SDL colour or animated
// cursors, per cursor and direction as Win32Mouse keeps its HCURSORs.
