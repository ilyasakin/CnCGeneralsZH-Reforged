// SdlKeyTable.h: SDL3 scancodes to the engine's DirectInput key codes, in one table (C3, decision 3).
//
// The engine, its bindings (CommandMap*.ini) and every key test in its code speak DirectInput's DIK
// codes: positions on a PC keyboard.  SDL's scancodes are positions too - USB HID usage IDs - and the
// same on every platform SDL runs on, so one table serves macOS and Linux alike.  Each of the 107 DIK
// codes the engine carries (GameClient/DIKeyCodes.h) is either reached from some scancode here or on
// the unreachable list with the reason; test_sdl_input fails on any that is neither.
//
// Keys that reach nothing, on purpose: the GUI keys (Command on a Mac, the Windows keys on a PC - the
// engine has no DIK code for either, and Command belongs to the system: Cmd+Q comes as SDL_EVENT_QUIT,
// the path Alt+F4 takes), Pause (not among the engine's codes), F13 and up, the keypad '=' of a Mac
// keyboard, and the application key.
