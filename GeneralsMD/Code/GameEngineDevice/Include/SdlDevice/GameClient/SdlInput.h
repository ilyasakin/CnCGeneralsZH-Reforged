// SdlInput.h: SDL3's input events to the engine's keyboard, mouse and text input (C3, decision 3).
//
// What WndProc does on Windows for WM_KEY*, WM_CHAR, WM_IME_* and the mouse messages.
// SdlGameEngine::serviceWindowsOS polls SDL's events, keeps quit and focus for itself, and hands every
// other event here.  Each goes where its Windows counterpart went:
//   - key presses and releases to SdlKeyboard as DIK codes (SdlKeyTable), SDL's repeats dropped;
//   - text to the IME manager (PosixIMEManager): committed text, the composition, and Return/keypad
//     Enter as the '\r' WM_CHAR carries;
//   - mouse motion, buttons and the wheel to SdlMouse, in the game's pixels.
// A device that does not exist yet (the keyboard and mouse are made in GameClient::init, after the
// first events can arrive) is skipped, as WndProc skips a NULL TheWin32Mouse.
