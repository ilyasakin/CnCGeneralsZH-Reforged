// AniCursor.h: Windows animated cursor files (.ANI) decoded to RGBA frames (C3).
//
// Win32Mouse gives the game its default cursors (RM_WINDOWS) with LoadCursorFromFile over the 52
// Data/Cursors/*.ANI files.  Off Windows SdlMouse makes SDL cursors from what this decodes.  The format:
// a RIFF "ACON" file with an 'anih' header, optional 'rate' (per-step durations, in jiffies of 1/60 s)
// and 'seq ' (per-step frame indices) chunks, and a LIST 'fram' of 'icon' chunks, each a whole .CUR or
// .ICO file holding a device-independent bitmap: a BITMAPINFOHEADER, a palette at 8 bits or fewer, the
// colour (XOR) rows and a 1-bit AND mask, both bottom-up.  Every frame the game ships is a 32 x 32
// .CUR at 4 bits; this reads 1, 4, 8, 24 and 32 bits.  No SDL here: bytes in, pixels out.
//
// What a bitmap cursor cannot become: an AND bit set over a non-black colour inverts the screen under
// it on Windows.  There is no such pixel in an SDL colour cursor; it is made transparent, and counted.
// PNG-compressed frames (Vista icons) are refused; the game has none.
