// SdlDisplays: SDL3's display list as Monitors.h's PlatformDisplays table (C2), which the options menu,
// borderless mode and the window placement read.  SdlGameEngine installs it once SDL's video is up and
// takes it down before SDL's video stops; with no table Monitors.h keeps its one 800x600 monitor.
//
// Sizes are in pixels, as on Windows, where the game is DPI-aware: SDL reports a display in points
// with a pixel density (2 on a Retina panel), and each size here is the points times that density.  A
// monitor's rect is its SDL bounds scaled by its own density, origin included, so the renderer (D4)
// divides by the same density to place a window in SDL's points.
//
// Monitors are numbered in SDL's order and named "\\.\DISPLAY<n>", the shape Windows gives the device
// Options.ini stores; the name is SDL's (the panel's, "Built-in Retina Display").
