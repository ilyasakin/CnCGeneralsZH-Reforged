// SdlGameEngine: the game engine off Windows with SDL3 underneath (C2).  PosixGameEngine (C1 (f)) has
// the file systems, the network and the browser; this adds what WinMain and its window procedure do
// on Windows:
//   - the window, which it owns: none at all under -headless, where SDL's video is never started,
//     so a headless run needs no display (E1's replay runs are on machines without one);
//   - the event pump (serviceWindowsOS), with a close request and the application's focus handled
//     as WM_CLOSE and WM_ACTIVATEAPP are;
//   - the window's title, through GameText's hook (GameClient/ApplicationWindowTitle.h);
//   - the displays, as Monitors.h's table (SdlDisplays.h), while SDL's video is up;
//   - MessageBoxWrapper's box, as SDL_ShowMessageBox over the window (SdlMessageBox.h);
//   - W3DDevice's window calls, through its hooks (W3DWindowHooks.h): a change of window mode or
//     resolution restyles, resizes and places the SDL window as W3DDisplay does ApplicationHWnd on
//     Windows, and ApplicationHWnd itself is the SDL window.
// Nothing draws into the window until A3; the device is decision 7's, made with no window under
// -headless (decision 8, refined).
//
// The factories are Win32GameEngine's, the same W3D classes (decision 8), W3DGameClient's Bink video
// player included since V1.  Audio is
// MilesAudioManager, over the Miles surface on miniaudio (C4).
