"""Give the Infantry General's skirmish AI its Mini-Gunner paradrop on Normal.

EA wrote the paradrop scripts for player [9], SkirmishChinaInfantryGeneral, on Hard alone ("China
Infantry Drop Fire - H" and "China Infantry Drop AI - H"), although both of its skill sets buy the
three Infa_SCIENCE_InfantryParadrop ranks, so on Normal it spends three points and never drops. The
Tank General has a Normal pair, "China Tank Drop Fire" and "China Tank Drop AI", that waits for the
power and nothing else. This copies the Hard pair to Normal in that shape: the _LAUNCH_ATTACK flag
left out of the condition, the difficulty flags Normal only, and the script names they enable and
disable renamed to match.

usage: infantry_drop.py <in.scb> <out.scb>

The master is the retail file through opening.py H 1 4 5 6, then through this.
